In a 4K masterpiece of stunning aesthetic and high resolution, an ultra-detailed extreme close-up reveals a modern dark vampire goddess suspended in a haunting stillness, emerging from the nocturnal mist. The torii gate on a cliff silhouetted behind her, barely visible amidst the twilight blue hour. Her hooded cloak billows around her fragile, kneeling form, the tessen fan clutched tightly in one hand, an omamori charm dangling from its edge.

Her porcelain skin and luminous white hair are stark contrasts against vast organic wings, a diabolical fusion of layered feathers and torn membranous flesh, subtly scarred, shadow-stained or ash-dusted, emerging naturally from fragile shoulder bones. The camera angle is a medium shot, focusing on her stoic expression, the dramatic play of shadows accentuating her lips and jawline, while volumetric lighting illuminates her mouth and teeth in an eerie glow.

The restrained monochrome color palette, punctuated by festival lanterns, creates a fine cinematic grain, and a softly diffused, high-contrast photographic finish further enhances the oppressive and sacred atmosphere of this hauntingly beautiful tableau., <lora:ZIT_Midjourney_Luneva_Cinematic_v1_r128:0.50><lora:Z-Breast-Slider:1>
