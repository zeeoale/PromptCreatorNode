In the cold embrace of a 4K frame, an extreme close-up unveils a modern dark vampire goddess suspended in the stillness of a Nepalese temple's dimly lit chamber. Enshrouded by swirling nocturnal mist, she emerges with ethereal grace from the somber ambience, her luminous white hair and porcelain skin stark against the shadows that dance upon her features. Her vast organic wings—a macabre fusion of layered feathers and torn membranous flesh—stretch out naturally from fragile shoulder bones, their edges stained with shadow and ash.

With a front-facing mask of vertical symmetry, her possessed stare pierces through the veil of time, her mouth and teeth accentuated by volumetric lighting that casts dramatic shadows upon her jawline and lips. The ritual smoke swirling around her adds an air of mystique, while golden earrings adorn her earlobes, their gleam providing a stark contrast to the monochrome color palette. The fine cinematic grain and softly diffused high-contrast photographic finish create an oppressive and sacred atmosphere that echoes the chanted terror of ancient occult legends. This ultra-detailed masterpiece, captured in amazing quality, is a testament to the horror and beauty that lies at the heart of dark vampire folklore., <lora:ZIT_Midjourney_Luneva_Cinematic_v1_r128:0.50><lora:Z-Breast-Slider:1>
