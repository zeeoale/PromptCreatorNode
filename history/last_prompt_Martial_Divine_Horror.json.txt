In the heart of the Sanctified War Age, a lone female figure emerges from the crimson mist, her regal presence heavy and immersive. Clad in blood-red ritual garments that veil her form beneath layers of exquisite fabrics, her elegance is a testament to the power she holds. Her heart-shaped face, high cheekbones, narrow jaw, almond eyes with icy gray hues, delicate nose, and heart-shaped lips are softened by subtle under-eye shadows. Her long, lavender hair, parted in the center and adorned with soft waves, frames a visage of contained anger and tense jaw, sharp gaze that speaks of her East Asian lineage, either Japanese or Korean.

Intricate and otherworldly, her ceremonial armor is tattered and frayed, its divine provenance evident in the unholy sunburst that adorns it. The supernatural halo of radiant sigils around her head casts a ghostly glow on the temple ruins behind her, drenched in red fog. A hooded figure looms nearby, ready to strike with divine calm and quiet holy fury.

The scene unfolds in a cinematic full-body shot, smoke drifting languidly around her as celestial light breaks through the darkness. The sacred sword she holds shimmers with glowing engravings, its transcendent terror tempered by the weight of sacred judgment it represents. Floating ritual objects hover ominously above, drifting petals and ashes swirling around her in a maelstrom of ritual transcendence. The entire vision is rendered in 4k, ultra-detailed, with amazing quality, absurdres, newest technology, showcasing depth of field and volumetric lighting that heightens the atmosphere's oppressive yet ethereal beauty., <lora:ZIT_Midjourney_Luneva_Cinematic_v1_r128:0.50><lora:Z-Breast-Slider:1>
