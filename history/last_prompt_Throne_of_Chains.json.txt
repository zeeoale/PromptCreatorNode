In the heart of an industrial, underground garage, bathed in the soft glow of low-key red neon, a striking figure emerges. The woman, embodying the Neo-Gothic aesthetic, is clad in a long, flowing black cloak that billows elegantly, reflecting the neon lights and casting intricate patterns on the cold, concrete floor below. Her ensemble subtly juxtaposes the harshness of her surroundings with a delicate silk gown hidden beneath the cloak, its hue harmonizing with the surrounding red neon. Black iron chains bind her to a makeshift throne, adding an air of both oppression and authority. One leg is casually positioned forward, exuding a sense of control and defiance. Her gaze is sharp and unyielding, a fierce glare that challenges the very essence of the space around her. The composition skillfully captures a dramatic half-body shot, highlighting the chains coiling around her arms like serpents, while a single strand of blood drips from her lips, symbolizing sacred blasphemy and dark rituals. The image is beautifully framed against the backdrop of the neon-reflected garage, enhancing the overall sense of mystique and rebellion. Post-process techniques are delicately employed to emphasize contrast, shadow, and highlights, creating a powerful, evocative image that captures the essence of a dark ritual queen bound in chains and blood., <lora:Asa_Model_AI(ZImageTurbo):1>traumakom_asa<lora:Z-Breast-Slider:1>
