Extreme close-up: a beautiful anime woman in Baroque-gothic finery—obsidian corset adorned with bone rosaries—holds the frame dead-center, head slightly tilted, her unwavering gaze burning through an ornate black-and-gold filigree mask as crimson teardrop earrings tremble above a metal-lace choker marked with a sacred sigil; candlelight carves soft flicker-shadows over the vague silhouette of gothic stained glass while a ritual thurible exhales crimson smoke, a sacred book lies clamped shut beneath a bleeding wax seal beside a baroque cross with a red gemstone core, and the air grows viscous with divine dread and blasphemous sanctity, where bleeding sigils drift like embers and her devotional trance mouths silent vows of pain., <lora:RetroAnimeFluxV1:1>power<lora:Helly_Model:1>hellymodel
