In the pulsating heart of the '80s metropolis, a rebellious punk dinosaur, adorned with a vibrant mohawk of coral and teal, strums an electric guitar bathed in tungsten's warm, golden glow. The alley, splashed with graffiti, is drenched in greenish shadows that dance with halation, creating an off-white contrast against the brick walls. A 50mm lens captures this scene, hinting at anamorphic distortion as it shoulder-holds the framing, placing the dinosaur mural strategically to adhere to the rule of thirds, with graffiti-covered bricks occluding the foreground. The alley pulses with a retro punk energy, the neon lights casting gentle vignettes and flickering with mild bloom. A layer of film grain clings to every surface, echoing the gritty texture of this urban underworld, while the gate noise hums a melancholic tune, underscoring the raw authenticity of this moment in time., <lora:graffiti-style-v1.1:1>GRFTI, <lora:Helly_Model:1>hellymodel
