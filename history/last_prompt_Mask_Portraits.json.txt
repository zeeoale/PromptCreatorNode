In a mythical Edo-period scene, a Japanese woman with a fox spirit charm hanging from her ear stands out against an antique paper screen with calligraphy; her face, illuminated by a single spotlight from below, reveals a cracked mask with faint traces of blood or wear, its gold cords dangling along the edges, capturing the essence of traditional ukiyo-e with its woodblock textures, flat color planes, and a restrained palette of indigo, vermilion, sand, and pine green, viewed from a slight three-quarter angle, the strong contour lines, subtle paper fiber texture, and the delicate misregistration of colors, along with edge darkening, adding to the sense of mystery and allure of this masked beauty., <lora:WornPhotos-000019:1>worn photo<lora:Ukiyo-e_LoRa_Style:1>ukiyo-e woodblock print<lora:Helly_Model:1>hellymodel
