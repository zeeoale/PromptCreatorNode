In a 4K, ultra-detailed masterpiece, a modern dark goddess emerges from nocturnal mist and sacred stillness, her luminous white hair and porcelain skin stark against vast organic wings formed of torn membranous flesh, subtly scarred and shadow-stained. Camera angles from an extreme close-up reveal the intricate details of her wing's layered feathers, emergence naturally from fragile shoulder bones. The atmosphere is a techno-religious dystopia, with a restrained monochrome color palette and fine cinematic grain, softly diffused and high-contrast in photographic finish.

The scene unfolds within a dark industrial chamber dripping with synthetic oil, volumetric lighting casting harsh directional light through smoke, illuminating the glowing runes on her latex priestess robe. Broken android limbs scattered on ritual ground bear witness to her trance-like devotion and kneeling reverence in three-quarter view. Tubular connectors along neck and spine hint at cybernetic gothic spirituality, while the quiet mechanical devotion is bathed in red light, a testament to the oppressive and sacred atmosphere., <lora:ZIT_Midjourney_Luneva_Cinematic_v1_r128:0.50><lora:Z-Breast-Slider:1>
