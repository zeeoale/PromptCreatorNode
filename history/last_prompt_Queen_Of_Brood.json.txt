Brood Reign, a vision of ethereal beauty, is depicted in a sacred, over-the-shoulder pose, her flesh-woven robe, crafted from parasitic threads, hanging delicately from her shoulders, revealing a divine, womb-like glow emanating from within; her expression, one of serene detachment, contrasts the horrific nature of her surroundings, an infested cathedral hall, where the air is thick with the presence of larvae and parasitic infestations; cradled in her arms is a birthing sac, a grotesque yet fascinating sight, from which a parasitic infant emerges, its form a twisted mockery of human life; around her neck, parasite-woven jewelry, a macabre accessory, hangs heavily, its intricate design a testament to the gothic body horror that unfolds, as if the very fabric of her being is a canvas for the grotesque and the sacred to coexist in a haunting, immaculate tableau., <lora:ZIT_Midjourney_Luneva_Cinematic_v1_r128:0.50>
