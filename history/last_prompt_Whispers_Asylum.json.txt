In a hauntingly beautiful and ultra-detailed 4K masterpiece, an extreme close-up reveals a modern dark goddess emerging from the dense nocturnal mist and sacred stillness of a decaying 1920s hospital wing. Swathed in a tattered Victorian patient gown, her pale, luminous white hair and porcelain skin starkly contrast against vast organic wings, formed of layered feathers or torn membranous flesh, subtly scarred, shadow-stained, and ash-dusted. The delicate wings seem to emerge naturally from fragile shoulder bones, suspended in a dark void that echoes the hospital's dusty hall filled with rusty wheelchairs and an old wheelchair trapped behind glass. A blank stare emanates a disturbing calm, her eyes a chilling testament to her eternal confinement. The surreal glow from an unknown source illuminates her ethereal form, casting a fine cinematic grain across the frame, with a softly diffused, high-contrast photographic finish that accentuates every detail of this eerie, suspended moment. Worn on one wrist is a loose bracelet adorned with a number, hinting at her mysterious past and eternal torment. The low camera angle evokes a dreamlike quality, emphasizing the goddess's haunting beauty in a scene that exudes an oppressive yet sacred atmosphere., <lora:ZIT_Midjourney_Luneva_Cinematic_v1_r128:0.50><lora:Z-Breast-Slider:1>
