A high-angle cinematic shot captures a modern street angel mid-pivot in a rain-slicked graffiti alley, her feathered wings—luminous, clean-edged, and radiating soft neon hues—snapping open with dynamic precision as neon reflections ripple across wet asphalt, her luxury techwear outfit blending layered hoodie and cropped puffer with utility straps, reflective piping, and sneaker-heavy tailoring that glints under the neon rim light, her cobalt-blue hair slicked into a glossy side part with faint freckles and icy gray eyes locked in calm confidence, a soft half-smile hinting at serene neutrality as she balances on a skateboard with weight shifted, board angled, wings half-open for stability, a halo-shaped ear cuff catching the light and a soft halo charm swinging at her collar, micro-droplets clinging to her fabric and hair while volumetric lighting bathes the scene in cinematic bloom, the city’s cold winter breath visible as glittering ice particles swirl around her, the background a layered tapestry of spray paint cans, torn street posters, and a distant city intersection in light rain, all rendered in ultra-detailed 4K absurdres with depth of field and near-future citycore aesthetics, her East Asian (Japanese/Korean) features—heart-shaped face, high cheekbones, narrow jaw, and subtle upturn—radiating bold styling and teasing elegance without a trace of horror, a masterpiece of high-glam editorial allure where urban grit meets angelic glow., <lora:Studio Fortiche_E15:1>StudiFort art style
