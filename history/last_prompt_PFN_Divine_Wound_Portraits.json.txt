An extreme close-up of a mid-20s East Asian woman’s heart-shaped face, framed by a braided crown of smoky purple hair and a thorned diadem glowing with arcane glyphs, her icy gray almond eyes locked in a calm observational gaze beneath soft under-eye shadows, her lips a subtle cupid bow of velvety peach kissed by volumetric light, her pale skin etched with luminous scripture and sacred geometry that bleeds into the cracks of a bone corset inlaid with gold, all set against a smooth plaster wall splattered with cursed talismans and hand-brushed kanji sheets, the harsh sidelight carving chiaroscuro contrasts across her high cheekbones and narrow jaw while the atmosphere hums with restrained religious ecstasy, her expression a frozen hymn to divine acceptance where every wound is a glyph, every scar a psalm, and the air thrums with the weight of a cursed Renaissance iconography rendered in ultra-detailed 4k absurdres, the camera’s tight framing compressing her sacred silence into a single, hauntingly aesthetic moment of ritualized suffering and transcendent stillness., <lora:ZIT_Midjourney_Luneva_Cinematic_v1_r128:0.50><lora:Z-Breast-Slider:1>
