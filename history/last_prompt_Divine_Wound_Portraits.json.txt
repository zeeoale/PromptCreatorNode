In the apocalyptic twilight of a Cursed Renaissance, a 20s androgynous figure, with a heart-shaped face, high cheekbones, narrow jaw, almond icy eyes veiled by heavy lashes, a straight delicate nose, soft full lips with a slight cupid bow, and long platinum-white hair cascading in a heavy fringe, hangs suspended in a void. Her porcelain skin, faintly etched with under-eye shadows, exudes a detached melancholic calm that is both sensually charged and immersive.

Her erotic power resonates through elegance and stillness, as she deliberatively conceals her skin beneath couture fabrics, transforming restraint itself into the primary source of desire. Her enormous wings, formed from layers of scarred, shadow-stained or ash-dusted feathers or torn membranous flesh, emerge naturally from fragile shoulder bones, creating an arcane juxtaposition between luminous white hair and porcelain skin.

The camera captures this masterpiece in 4k, very aesthetic, high resolution, ultra-detailed, and absurdres, adopting a vertical frontal extreme close-up from below, allowing the viewer to be immersed in her tranquil sorrow. Harsh sidelight reveals cracks and fissures in her wings and Obsidian ritual armor, casting haunting shadows across the featureless black void that houses floating gilded fragments of broken halos.

The atmosphere is one of an Apocalyptic vision, with visceral but composed elements intertwining, creating a profound sense of sacredness, as arcane letters emerge from torn skin, further emphasizing the vertical frontal extreme close-up and the hyper close-up from below. The image is captured with a large-scale, non-repeating surface, a restrained monochrome color palette, and a fine cinematic grain, enhancing its high contrast photographic finish, volumetric lighting, and depth of field., <lora:ZIT_Midjourney_Luneva_Cinematic_v1_r128:0.50><lora:Z-Breast-Slider:1>
