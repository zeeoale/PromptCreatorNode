A claustrophobic extreme close-up frames the subject’s icy gray eyes, narrow nose bridge, and softly parted lips in a 85mm cinematic embrace, where smeared mascara bleeds into glittering tear trails, porcelain-like skin glows with damp translucence, and a thin silver necklace cradles a faintly engraved TK pendant at the collarbone’s edge, all bathed in low-key silvery light that fractures into halation and soft bloom around the subject’s oval face—its refined jawline and balanced proportions offset by a subtle, sensual bite on the lower lip, while a hand wrapped in torn mesh rests near the mouth, fingers brushing against a teal-black hair strand caught in a side part, the hair’s glossy sheen reflecting the faint chromatic aberration of a chapel-like foggy bokeh background, where shadowy corridor shapes dissolve into volumetric light and dust motes, the subject’s half-lidded eyes holding an oppressive close crop of quiet intensity, their breath visible as humidity in the cold, desaturated air, a faint ‘TK’ tag stitched into the fabric seam of a torn lace glove, all rendered in 4k ultra-detailed absurdres with film grain, vignette, and a horror_intensity modulated by the unsettling catchlights in the eyes and the oppressive contrast of the damp decay mood, capturing a late-90s underground gothic editorial moment of restrained desire and soft defiance, the subject’s confident body language lingering in the tension between exposed vulnerability and controlled elegance., <lora:ZIT_Midjourney_Luneva_Cinematic_v1_r128:0.50><lora:Z-Breast-Slider:1>
