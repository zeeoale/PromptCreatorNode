In the hush of midnight, a contemporary goth girl lounges on her vintage velvet chaise longue within her intimate sanctuary, a blackened den of subdued luxury adorned with abstract occult art, monochrome photography, and posters of dark bands that whisper haunting melodies. The room is softly lit by bedside lamps casting ambient shadows upon worn textures and scattered personal objects, their dim glow accentuating the volumetric lighting emanating from a single LED source, a beacon within the darkness. Her bedside table, cluttered with modern gothic rings and dark candles, stands as a testament to her solitary nocturnal existence.

Draped in a slim black waistcoat, the girl's mid-20s form is framed by blunt bangs cascading over her delicate features: an oval face, soft jawline, balanced proportions, round eyes with bright catchlights reflecting the room's dim light, icy gray irises gazing back into the camera with a serious, focused look. Her copper red hair is styled in a short bob cut, its smooth porcelain-like texture and cool to neutral undertone contrasting sharply with her dark makeup - black lipstick and smudged eyeliner, or perhaps the suggestion of black tears, that lend an air of menacing calm to her otherwise sophisticated demeanor.

This high-resolution, ultra-detailed 4k scene is a masterpiece of contemporary gothic imagery, with shallow depth of field, direct-to-camera portrait framing, and cinematic composition that captures the introspective tension and emotional depth within this Neo-Gothic Contemporary setting. A black cat perched upon the edge of her bed seems to watch over its mistress, adding a sinister element to the quiet intimacy that permeates the room, casting an aura of haunting sophistication and horror around the girl and her private sanctuary., <lora:ZIT_Midjourney_Luneva_Cinematic_v1_r128:0.50><lora:Z-Breast-Slider:1>
