In a stark and ancient frozen world, a beautiful woman with wild devotion and reverence for the wolves that surround her stands proudly, clad in flowing silk robes adorned with subtle lunar symbols, their fluidity contrasting the static, snow-covered landscape; she holds a totemic staff topped with a silver crescent moon, a necklace of direwolf fangs resting upon her chest, her fur mantle painted with blood red accents and framed by a wolf bone circlet, all illuminated by the warm flickering torchlight with a low-angle composition that captures the looming presence of the wolves and the towering cliffs above, the silver and pale moonlight palette of her attire harmonizing with the cool blue hues of the icy realm, this fantastical scene is further enhanced through meticulous post-processing that accentuates the crispness of the winter environment and the ethereal beauty of the woman's attire, a wide-angle lens captures the vastness of the landscape and the small yet significant figures of the wolves, their leader, and the wild realm they inhabit., <lora:MJanime_Flux_LoRa_v3_Final:1>anime
