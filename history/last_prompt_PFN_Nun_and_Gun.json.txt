A hauntingly cinematic extreme close-up, framed by a shallow depth of field and a grain-laden 4K ultra-detailed lens, captures the icy gray eyes of a mid-20s East Asian woman with heart-shaped features and cobalt-blue hair, her face a study of cold simmering rage and controlled dominance, her lips parted in a subtle upturn that hints at restrained sensuality, her pale skin glowing under dim ceremonial lighting that casts a soft, almost sacred glow around her glossy latex black nun habit, its corset lacing and slit skirt tensioned in a dance of ritual stillness, her body angled across an altar edge with a gaze deliberately off-frame, her braided crown and sacred pendants glinting like modern weaponry, the modern pistol resting beside her as a symbolic prop, its metallic sheen contrasting with the muted geometry of the minimal sanctified space, the atmosphere thick with sacrilegious tension where sacred iconography and psychological horror merge, her high cheekbones and narrow jaw etched in shadow, her soft under-eye shadows and cool undertone framing an emotionally distant expression that commands both reverence and dread, the camera lingering on the interplay of light and fabric, the volumetric glow of the altar’s recesses, and the quiet decay of a space suspended between worship and transgression, all rendered in a restrained, high-fashion aesthetic that marries East Asian elegance with a dangerous, intimate stillness., <lora:ZIT_Midjourney_Luneva_Cinematic_v1_r128:0.50><lora:Z-Breast-Slider:1>
