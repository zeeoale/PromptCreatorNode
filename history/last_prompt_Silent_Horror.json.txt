In the heart of a decrepit, decaying mansion shrouded in an oppressive fog, a woman of ethereal beauty, her figure accentuated by a seductively tight, low-cut dress from another era, emerges from the shadows. The dim ambient light flickers intermittently between the harsh strobes of fluorescents and the warm diegetic glow of a single tungsten bulb, casting an eerie palette of desaturated steel blue, blood rust, and candle ember across the crumbling walls. As the camera moves with a 35-50mm lens, handheld and tilted Dutch or creeping in on a dolly, it navigates through the mist and drifting particles, emphasizing the claustrophobic depth of the scene, where grime, pipes, and torn curtains obscure the foreground. The composition is further heightened by an analog grain effect, bloom over practicals, faint chromatic bleed, and gate jitter, creating a sense of suffocating dread that lingers as the woman's silent scream echoes through the silence, her hunched back silhouetted against the rusty wheelchair in the background., <lora:Asa_Model_AI(ZImageTurbo):1>traumakom_asa<lora:Z-Breast-Slider:1>
