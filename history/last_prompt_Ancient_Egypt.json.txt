In the dim, tomb-kissed stillness of a late Period scenery, an ethereal figure, her youthful visage etched upon a delicate oval face with a soft jawline, gentle high cheekbones, and almond-shaped dark brown eyes that bore an epicanthic fold, is suspended amidst the void. Her long, straight jet-black hair, silky in texture and adorned with blunt bangs, cascades like raven feathers over her smooth natural skin tone. The subtle curves of her small straight nose with a low bridge and small defined lips, topped by a soft cupid bow, are veiled beneath couture fabrics, her erotic power expressed through elegance, stillness, and the deliberate concealment of skin. Her luminous white hair and porcelain skin stand in stark contrast against vast organic wings, torn membranous flesh emerging naturally from fragile shoulder bones, subtly scarred, shadow-stained or ash-dusted, a testament to her otherworldly nature.

The camera, positioned in an extreme close-up, captures this masterpiece in the newest 4k resolution, offering ultra-detailed and absurdres visuals of this sensually charged female figure whose presence feels slow, heavy, and immersive. The restrained monochrome color palette is enriched with a soft cinematic grain, lending a fine photographic finish to the scene. The lighting is dominated by a sun-baked rim light with warm bounce, casting an ethereal glow upon the figure and the tomb corridor covered in hieroglyphic reliefs. A raking light, macro 90–100mm in length, illuminates the carvings with museum-grade clarity, while volumetric lighting adds depth to the sacred omens that surround her. Seated on a throne adorned with a tall crown (hedjet or deshret) stylized in gold thread, she holds herself with graceful confidence, her hands resting gently upon her lap. A ritual veil or shawl edge is visible in the golden thread, adding a touch of supernatural charge to the scene, while glowing glyphs and living statues bear witness to her arrival, their silent voices echoing through the stillness. The atmosphere is both oppressive and sacred, hinting at a world beyond our own, where horror and beauty intertwine in perfect harmony., <lora:ZIT_Midjourney_Luneva_Cinematic_v1_r128:0.50><lora:Z-Breast-Slider:1>
