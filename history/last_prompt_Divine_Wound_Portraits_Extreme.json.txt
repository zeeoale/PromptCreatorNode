A claustrophobic hyper-close-up of an East Asian woman’s face, her oval jawline softened by a faint, porcelain-like sheen of damp skin, where icy gray eyes—deep-set, intense, and rimmed with smudged mascara tears—peer through a monastic hood frayed with burnt embroidery, its shadowy folds dissolving into a chapel’s foggy bokeh of faded fresco ghosts and dripping candle wax, her narrow nose bridge glistening with silver highlights from a cold, top-down cathedral beam slicing through incense-laden air, lips parted in a soft, closed-lip smile tinged with lavender pigment, her hands trembling near her mouth as torn mesh clings to pale, teal-black hair slicked into a side part, a thin silver necklace catching the light with a tiny TK pendant engraved at her collarbone’s edge, the air thick with Plague-era fever dreams and gold leaf fragments embedded in scarred calligraphy, her expression a delicate balance of controlled rage and calm confidence, the camera’s 85mm lens compressing the scene into a shallow depth of field where film grain, halation, and soft bloom blur the boundary between flesh and relic, her face a frozen tableau of religious ecstasy, the faintest chromatic aberration tracing the edges of her half-framed, iconically dread-filled visage, all bathed in low-key silvery light and the cold, simmering tension of a world on the brink of collapse, her skin a canvas of micro-details—pores, stray hair strands, metal jewelry reflections—each whispering of a gothic-fineart ritual where the past and present decay in perfect, desaturated harmony., <lora:ZIT_Midjourney_Luneva_Cinematic_v1_r128:0.50><lora:Z-Breast-Slider:1>
