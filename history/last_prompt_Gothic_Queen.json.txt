In a gritty urban landscape, drenched in the cold, neon glow of a rain-soaked cityscape, a figure emerges from the shadows. The scene is captured through an extreme close-up lens, approximately 24mm wide angle, framing a sensual and enigmatic woman, her long, intense cobalt-blue hair cascading down in heavy fringe. Her heart-shaped face, with high cheekbones, narrow jaw, almond icy eyes, heavy lashes, straight delicate nose, soft full lips, slight cupid bow, porcelain skin, and faint under-eye shadows, exudes a detached melancholic calm that is both captivating and intimidating.

Wrapped in a masterpiece of Victorian-inspired couture, the woman's erotic power is not overtly expressed but rather subtly conveyed through elegance, stillness, and the deliberate concealment of skin beneath the rich fabrics. A solid ritual veil, Gothic in design with an ornate black crown adorned with red gemstones, fully covers her upper face and eyes, adding to the mystery that surrounds her.

The environment is tangible and contemporary, with wet concrete, urban decay, and signage reflections creating a fashion-forward noir atmosphere. The camera is positioned at a worm's-eye or extreme low-angle viewpoint, emphasizing the dominance of the figure as she sits regally on a Gothic throne in the foreground, while strong leading lines created by architecture, cables, and signage draw the eye towards her.

The lighting is volumetric, with spotlit crown highlights casting a dark maroon gradient across her face, while subtle film grain and a restrained neon color palette where magenta and cyan rim light sculpt the body and textures further emphasize the cinematic, photorealistic quality of the image. The scene is ultra-detailed, high resolution, and 4k, making it a true work of art that is both visually stunning and emotionally charged., <lora:ZIT_Midjourney_Luneva_Cinematic_v1_r128:0.50><lora:Z-Breast-Slider:1>
