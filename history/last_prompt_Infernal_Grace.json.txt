In a 4K ultra-detailed masterpiece, the lens zooms in on an heretical woman, her luminous white hair and skin starkly contrasting against the black, oily machinery of cables, chains, and mechanical wings that merge with fragile bones, merging gothic beauty with biomechanical horror. The camera angle hovers slightly above, capturing a high-resolution, absurdres close-up of her face, bathed in volumetric lighting that illuminates the shimmering tattered ritual veils on her head, which seem to morph into hot ash as they catch fire from the warm haze emanating from an ancient ruin in the background. The cracked walls are glowing with magma veins, and burning sigils float around her body, creating a cavern of eternal embers. Her hips subtly turn, revealing ritual markings beneath, as her mysterious half-lidded eyes gaze over her shoulder, their golden sparks floating in the warm haze adding to the dreamlike quality of the scene. The atmosphere is thick with ancient infernal pressure that radiates through the ground, giving a sense of unease and dread. Accessorized with ritual bracelets shaped from molten metal, this seductive but frightening demon exudes an aura of ancient predatory power, her horns sharp as blades and fiery gaze piercing through the veil of smoke and haze. The overall color palette is monochrome, dominated by shades of black, white, and red, with a cinematic, slightly soft-focus finish that adds to the surreal, otherworldly feel of the illustration., traumakom_asa<lora:bo zImage-Digital Abyss v0.3:1>bo-abyss
