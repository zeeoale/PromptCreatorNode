In the twilight hour, a forgotten cemetery shrouded in decay unfurls its somber beauty. The crumbling tombstones, etched with time and erosion, stand like sentinels amidst an industrial wasteland where flickering fluorescent lights cast eerie shadows. Beyond this grim expanse lies a dense forest, concealing the long-abandoned structure with rotting wooden doors. The scene captures a wide, oppressive perspective, the S-curve of the terrain leading the eye through an air thick with mold and dread. Blood trails and occult symbols mark the ground, signs of violence adding to the haunting atmosphere. As dusk settles, the palette transitions from earth tones to sky blues, harmoniously blending the decaying cemetery and the encroaching darkness. Post-processing enhances color harmony, dehazes the thick air, amplifies local contrast, and gently vignettes the image, immersing the viewer in a chilling tableau of decay and mystery., <lora:_Dragon_:1>DRG1<lora:Helly_ModelV2:1>hellymodelV2
