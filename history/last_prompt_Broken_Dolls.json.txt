In the heart of a haunting ritual setting, an ethereal feminine figure looms under dim underlight, her countenance veiled in tactile dread. Her porcelain skin, a canvas marred by faint traces of dried blood and ritual pigment, glows under the cold overhead smoke diffusion, its corpse gray palette subtly contrasting with the iron red and blackened violet hues of the ceremony. The air thickens with incense, punctuated by slow drifting ash and breath vapor, creating an oppressive atmosphere.

A 100 mm macro lens captures her visage in intricate detail, shallow depth emphasizing the symmetry of her harmonious proportions - a compact oval face framed by a short chin, almond eyes with steel blue irises that hold a gentle openness yet bear a relaxed yet calm observational gaze. Her natural volume lips are painted dark, their smooth edges contrasting the soft inner corners of her eyes and petite nose with rounded tip.

Her lush cobalt-blue hair cascades in high twin-tails, straight fringe, long flowing lengths, creating a stark juxtaposition against her pale skin and the aged metal, cracked bone, and frayed linen surrounding her. The soft matte finish of her skin reveals minimal blemishes, save for a few micro cracks reminiscent of cobwebs, while volumetric lighting casts a sickly greenish hue over her face.

The setting transports the viewer to the Victorian era, where the figure appears amidst wax drippings and scenery bathed in soft light filtered through cobwebs, contrasted by the black void filled with incense smoke. Her presence is hauntingly still, her erotic power expressed not through gore or explicitness, but rather through her elegant concealment beneath couture fabrics, her beauty enhanced by the newest 4k, ultra-detailed, and absurdres post-processing techniques that accentuate depth of field and volumetric lighting. The extreme close-up on her broken mask - missing button eyes, haunting silence, and stitched mouth - only serves to amplify the body horror of mutilated limbs and fused faces present in the ritual setting., <lora:ZIT_Midjourney_Luneva_Cinematic_v1_r128:0.50><lora:Z-Breast-Slider:1>
