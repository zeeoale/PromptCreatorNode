Create an image of two stunning women, sisters in Gothic Rituals, standing amidst a moonlit forest clearing. They are dressed in tattered cultist robes, their faces illuminated by the soft crimson glow reflecting off the mist that hangs in the air. The moonlight filters through the trees, casting an eerie glow upon the scene, with tendrils of incense smoke and whispers twisting and turning in the gentle breeze.

At the center of the clearing stands a rustic forest altar, adorned with bone totems, black candles, and intricate rune carvings. The women, with serene yet intense expressions, are engaged in a sacred ritual. One woman holds a bone staff, intricately engraved with ancient symbols, while the other uses a thin brush to carefully paint matching runes upon her sister's exposed skin, their arms and shoulders bare, the cloth draped around them.

The runes glow faintly, a subtle heretic ecstasy in the women's eyes as they whisper ancient incantations, their breath forming clouds in the cold night air. The low angle of the camera captures the dramatic shadows cast by the moonlight, emphasizing the mysterious and otherworldly atmosphere.

The scene is filled with a sense of quiet power, the women's devotion, and the beauty of their forbidden rituals. The image captures a moment of intense focus and spiritual connection, a glimpse into a secret world of Gothic fantasy and moonlit ceremonies., <lora:Detailed_Hands-000001:1>detailed hands, <lora:breast-size_822995:1><lora:Niji_semi-realism_flux:1>dress, this digital drawing
