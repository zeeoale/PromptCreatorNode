In the oppressive stillness of a near-future metropolis bathed in soft blue night light, punctuated by subtle neon accents, an androgynous figure hovers, suspended between the gritty reality and the ethereal realm. The delicate balance is maintained by torn fishnet stockings intertwined with harness belts, a cyberpunk streetwear mix that defies the conventional boundaries of time and space. The figure leans back against a railing, gaze fixed on the distant flying drones and blurred neon signs of the sprawling cityscape. Their luminous white hair cascades down their porcelain skin in a halo-like veil, contrasting starkly with vast organic wings that emerge naturally from fragile shoulder bones – an intricate fusion of layered feathers or torn membranous flesh, subtly scarred, shadow-stained, and ash-dusted. The camera captures this haunting spectacle in an extreme close-up, a 4k masterpiece of amazing quality, ultra-detailed, rendered with absurdres for unparalleled resolution. The image is imbued with a fine cinematic grain and a softly diffused, high-contrast photographic finish, enveloped by the dense urban fog that permeates the muted colors of the metropolis. The angelic or diabolical figure stands at the precipice of the city, lips slightly parted while smoking, exuding a subtle attitude that speaks volumes about their power and dominion over this dystopian landscape., <lora:985Z2HFFZGYWQHHXP2N02TKA60:1>d41z3n
