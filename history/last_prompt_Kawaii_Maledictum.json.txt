In an ultra-detailed, 4K masterpiece of absurdist horror, a modern dark goddess emerges from the enigmatic embrace of nocturnal mist and sacred stillness. The camera lenses, capturing this macabre spectacle in amazing quality, adopt a first-person view, plunging us directly into the scene. A volumetric lighting effect, akin to swirling fairy lights, illuminates her figure, casting an eerie glow upon her form. Her exquisitely rendered porcelain skin and luminous white hair contrast starkly with vast organic wings that appear both angelic and diabolical - a tapestry of layered feathers or torn membranous flesh, subtly scarred, shadow-stained, or ash-dusted, emerging naturally from fragile shoulder bones. The wings are captured in a soft cinematic grain, their edges blurred by syrupy mist hanging heavily in the air.

The goddess's seductive attire is a Kawaii Nightmare - a tight and low-cut dress that hugs her form, adorned with dead-eyed plushies and stained with blood. A single cupcake, its frosting oozing black ichor, clutched in her hand adds to the surreal tableau. The background, a foggy dreamscape, features melting cupcakes, further emphasizing the unsettling atmosphere. The scene is suffused with a high-resolution, high-contrast photographic finish, creating an oppressive and sacred atmosphere that lingers long after the image fades., <lora:ZIT_Midjourney_Luneva_Cinematic_v1_r128:0.50><lora:Z-Breast-Slider:1>
