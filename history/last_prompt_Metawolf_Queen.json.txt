Behold, in a realm where serenity and unease intertwine, an oracle, their eyes softly shut, revealing a trail of blood tears that form an intricate calligraphy of ancient wisdom across their face, stands as a frozen figure in an otherworldly setting; their flowing robes, adorned with lunar symbols, create a contrast against the backdrop of an icy forest illuminated by the celestial dance of auroras; white wolf spirits, a mystical presence, float in the air, as the oracle, in a low-angle shot, is flanked by two massive wolves, their wild and untamed nature reflected in the oracle's own fierce devotion; the wolves loom, their power and reverence for the oracle palpable, as a wolfbone circlet, a symbol of primal magic, rests upon the oracle's head, creating an image of sacred wilderness power and an unsettling, yet captivating, display of faith., <lora:ZIT_Midjourney_Luneva_Cinematic_v1_r128:0.50>
