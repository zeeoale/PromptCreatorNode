A Dutch tilt angle subtly warps the horizon, casting cinematic unease over a pristine NeoPop fashion portrait of a mid-20s subject with a soft oval face, icy gray cat-like eyes, and a fashion-pink urban asymmetrical haircut, her perfectly centered straight-on stance exuding silent pride as a color-block bodysuit with lacquered finish glows under a smooth digital backlight streaked with subtle chromatic aberration, while a vaporwave gradient circle with corrupted edges pulses in the background, its neon halo slightly misaligned to evoke a glitch-ridden Renaissance, her delicate jawline and rounded chin framed by a dark, modern edge as she sensually bites her lower lip, techno jewelry etched with micro-scratches and digital artifacts catching volumetric light, all rendered in 4k ultra-detailed absurdres with a mid-century modern atmosphere, where the tension between clean NeoPop futurism and synthetic dread simmers beneath a flawless surface, her fair skin and neutral undertones glowing with a dreamy calm that feels both empowering and eerily algorithmic, the scene layered with depth of field and a hauntingly symmetrical balance that masks the quiet fracture of a digital soul., <lora:phandigrams_E15:1>Phandigrams art style
