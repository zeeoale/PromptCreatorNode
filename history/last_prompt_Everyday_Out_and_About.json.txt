Beautiful anime-style woman in a contemporary city scene, waist-up portrait at eye level, standing beside a vibrant sidewalk flower stall outside a modern glass-and-steel restaurant; casual mid-rise denim jeans and a soft, slightly tucked blouse, a light neck scarf fluttering, minimal wristwatch, slim reading glasses perched low on her nose; she laughs softly with a warm, approachable smile, friendly lifestyle vibe. One hand cradles an open notebook with a pen between her fingers, the other resting near a canvas tote bag slung over her shoulder; a flaky pastry sits on a small plate on the café ledge beside her. Overcast daylight with soft, even, diffused illumination, gentle reflections in the restaurant windows, subtle rim light along her hair; shallow depth of field with creamy floral bokeh and buckets of peonies, ranunculus, and tulips adding pops of color. Clean anime linework, refined cel shading, smooth gradients, natural skin tones, glossy eyes with a light blush; soft neutral and pastel palette (denim blue, ivory, blush pink, sage green). 85mm lens look, f/2.8, rule-of-thirds composition, crisp focus on face and hands, no motion blur, no text or logos, studio-quality, ultra-detailed, high resolution., <lora:MJanime_Flux_LoRa_v3_Final:1> <lora:Helly_Model:1>hellymodel
