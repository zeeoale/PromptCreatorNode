In a gothic-inspired post-human renaissance, the image depicts a haunting yet ethereal scene within a vast, gray chapel, where two women, their forms bathed in a crimson glow, stand in a silent ritual, their bodies adorned with translucent synthetic veils covering intricate cranial implants, creating an otherworldly aura; the rim light halo, with its subtle bloom, adds an angelic touch to their ethereal presence, while the vast chapel, adorned with floating luminous glyphs, serves as a sacred industrial backdrop; one woman reaches out gently, her hand stretching towards the hollow aureole of segmented metal petals, a silent gesture of transcendence; the atmosphere is one of quiet devotion and beatific terror, with the women's three-quarter icon poses, etched sigil plates along their collars, and the revelation of hidden machinery beneath their angelic forms, all contributing to a haunting, cinematic composition, reminiscent of fine art, with a hint of oil painting depth and a chiaroscuro glow., <lora:ZIT_Midjourney_Luneva_Cinematic_v1_r128:0.50>
