A low-angle wide shot at 35mm lens captures a mid-20s East Asian netrunner in a sleek, black-and-silver netrunner suit with pulsating blue and magenta glowing interfaces etched into their torso, their porcelain skin glowing faintly under harsh fluorescent lights emanating from towering corporate high-rises, their heart-shaped face framed by long, layered chestnut-brown hair in a side part with a glossy finish, almond eyes the color of icy gray glinting with detached melancholic calm as they stand atop a corroded metal platform overlooking a rain-drenched cyberpunk city where flickering neon signs in toxic green and electric blue cast jagged shadows across wet asphalt, their holographic visor reflecting the chaos of chaotic urban energy as cybernetic implants pulse rhythmically along their neck and arms, the camera’s volumetric light rendering the scene in a gritty, high-contrast film-grain finish with soft under-eye shadows and a subtle upturn of their narrow jaw, their soft full lips slightly parted in intense focus as the storm’s cinematic rain effects blend with the city’s neon glow, creating a masterpiece of absurdres ultra-detailed 4k imagery where every reflective surface and depth of field amplifies the dystopian future’s technological excess and social collapse., <lora:Niji_E15:1>Niji art style
