In a timeless void cathedral, an extreme close-up reveals a sensually charged androgynous figure, her heart-shaped face framed by deep auburn, textured layers of a pixie cut cascading over the floor like a white river. Her eyes, icy gray and almond-shaped with heavy lashes, carry a controlled confidence that simmers beneath a subtle closed-lip smile. A single overhead light halo illuminates her porcelain skin, casting dramatic shadows that accentuate her high cheekbones, narrow jaw, and heart-shaped lips with delicate corners.

The figure's ritual shroud is shredded into long drifting ribbons, revealing an intense grotesque fusion of bone and machinery in her chest cavity. Torn flesh, open rib cage, and invasive cables evoke sacred but disturbing experimental torment, while her mechanical wings—a mesh of black, oily machinery merging with fragile bones—curl sideways against the endless dark void filled with drifting feathers, feather fragments stained with dark oil.

The camera's angle is a quiet post-ritual exhaustion, capturing the figure in an intense close-up on her upper torso, as if inviting viewers to peer into her wounded heart. The scene exudes an otherworldly calm despite the horrific fusion of flesh and metal, showcasing the erotic power expressed through elegance, stillness, and the deliberate concealment of skin beneath couture fabrics that transform restraint itself into the primary source of desire.

This realistic masterpiece is shot in 4k, very aesthetic, high resolution, ultra-detailed, absurdres, utilizing the newest scenery, depth of field, and volumetric lighting techniques to create a highly immersive, cinematic, slightly soft-focus finish that enhances the contrast between luminous white hair and skin and the black, oily machinery of cables, chains, and mechanical wings merging with fragile bones., <lora:ZIT_Midjourney_Luneva_Cinematic_v1_r128:0.50><lora:Z-Breast-Slider:1>
