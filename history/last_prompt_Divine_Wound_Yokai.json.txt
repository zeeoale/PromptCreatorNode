In a hauntingly ethereal foggy bamboo grove, the woman, embodying the corrupted shrine age, dons an eerie bone and rope ceremonial outfit. The mystique of her surroundings intensifies as Oni horns seamlessly emerge from her skin, blending with the enigmatic environment. Her eyes, glowing through a Hannya mask, exude a demonic ecstasy that echoes the ambiance. In an extreme close-up, warm neutral tones accentuate the intricate skin pores and micro-texture of her forehead, punctuated by the glowing kanji projected onto her skin – a symbol of her spiritual transformation. The single large soft source from 30–45° casts captivating catchlights on her eyes and sigils, while fine grain and subtle vignette lend an air of antiquity. Nails hammered through paper seals adorn her face, adding to the intense sigil coverage that signifies her full spiritual breakdown within the yokai-filled mist. The scene is a masterful blend of macro photography, thematic elements, and supernatural aesthetics that immerses viewers in the world of Japanese folklore., <lora:Asa_Model_AI(ZImageTurbo):1>traumakom_asa<lora:Z-Breast-Slider:1>
