A vertical extreme close-up portrait, framed in a tight 4K ultra-detailed lens, captures the face of a mid-20s East Asian woman with heart-shaped features, high cheekbones, narrow jaw, icy gray almond eyes framed by soft under-eye shadows, a small button nose with a subtle upturn, and soft full lips forming a cupid bow, all rendered in painterly precision against a smooth plaster wall streaked with scattered paper talismans and hand-brushed cursed kanji sheets pinned irregularly, their ink bleeding into the cracks of a Plague-era fever dream; her pale skin, cool-toned and etched with subtle freckles, bears obsidian ritual armor fused to exposed collarbones, black thread stitching sacred geometries across her flesh while gold leaf fragments embed into scarred calligraphy, and her eyes—icy gray, unblinking—hold a serene yet unbearable expression as if carved from the same divine ichor seeping from her wounds, which are shaped into icon-like forms, their edges glowing faintly with cracked halos leaking faint light, while cathedral beams slice through the frame in extreme chiaroscuro, casting harsh sidelight across her face, her lips parted in a silent, controlled scream of religious ecstasy on the edge of collapse, her gaze locked in direct, symbolic tears that reflect incense fog and heavy film grain, the entire composition a frozen reliquary of sacred desecration where scripture and flesh merge in a pure, restrained elegance, her long platinum-white hair cascading in glossy layers down her side part, each strand catching the light like a cursed relic framed as jewelry, the atmosphere thick with oppressive stillness and the cold simmering rage of a divine abandonment etched into every pore., <lora:ZIT_Midjourney_Luneva_Cinematic_v1_r128:0.50><lora:Z-Breast-Slider:1>
