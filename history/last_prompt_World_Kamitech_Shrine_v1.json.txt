In a post-apocalyptic present, an androgynous dark goddess emerges from the hazy, desolate mist of a crumbling cathedral, her luminous white hair and porcelain skin in stark contrast with vast organic wings formed of layered feathers or torn membranous flesh. The wings, subtly scarred, shadow-stained, and ash-dusted, emerge naturally from fragile shoulder bones, their edges fraying like tattered fabric against the stone walls behind her.

An extreme close-up captures the scene with a 4k camera, framing the image in high resolution and ultra-detailed clarity, accentuated by an absurdres finish for an almost surreal level of detail. The camera angle is a low perspective, gazing up at the goddess from the worn stone floor, the weathered columns and simple masonry providing a stark backdrop against the goddess's regal pose.

The atmosphere is one of defiant faith mixed with an oppressive sense of the sacred—a horrifying beauty born from the ashes of a world long past. The goddess wears a modern black cassock with subtle embroidery, her fingerless embroidered gloves and clean robes giving an air of simplicity in the chaos around her.

The scene is bathed in soft moonlight, casting deep shadows across the goddess's face as she bows her head slightly, eyes up, gazing past the viewer with a serene expression that belies the turmoil within. A faint ember sparks near a thurible at her feet, creating a volumetric lighting effect that seems to envelop the goddess in a holy glow, casting intricate shadows across her face and form.

The image is characterized by a restrained monochrome color palette, with fine cinematic grain and a softly diffused, high-contrast photographic finish that enhances the ethereal, otherworldly quality of the goddess's presence. The depth of field adds to the sense of stillness and sacred silence, focusing the viewer's attention on the figure amidst the decaying surroundings., <lora:ZIT_Midjourney_Luneva_Cinematic_v1_r128:0.50><lora:Z-Breast-Slider:1>
