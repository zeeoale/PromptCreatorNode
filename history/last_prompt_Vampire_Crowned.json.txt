In the dim twilight of a crumbling Gothic chapel nave, a hauntingly beautiful pale figure is suspended in chilling stillness, their fragile shoulders bearing vast organic wings tattered like ancient parchment. The camera takes a 24mm low angle, capturing an extreme close-up view of the androgynous modern dark vampire goddess, whose elongated sharp fangs gleam with ivory canines catching the low light, casting eerie shadows on her solemn gaze. Her luminous white hair and porcelain skin starkly contrast against the vast organic wings formed of scarred, shadow-stained or ash-dusted membranous flesh, subtly reminiscent of fallen angelic forms.

A subtle predatory smile plays upon her lips, accentuated by dramatic shadow play on lips and jawline, while volumetric lighting emphasizes the mouth and teeth, their presence made all the more chilling by the absence of blood. She wears an ivory lace jabot shirt adorned with a silver signet ring bearing a vampiric sigil, all bathed in moonbeams that stream through stained glass windows, casting dusty godrays upon the scene. The atmosphere is one of oppressive yet sacred stillness, a chilling reminder of the creature's timeless, eternal presence within the desolate ruins of the chapel nave., <lora:ZIT_Midjourney_Luneva_Cinematic_v1_r128:0.50><lora:Z-Breast-Slider:1>
