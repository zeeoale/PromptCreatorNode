In the heart of a dense Showa backwoods, amidst an eerie nocturnal atmosphere, a hauntingly beautiful young woman stands, enshrouded in low-lying fog and softening shadows. The subject, dressed in a blood-stained white ceremonial kimono with a mud-soaked hem, is framed by the arched torii gate in a heroic, low-angle portrait composition, her long, heavy fringe obscuring part of her face. Her jet-black hair clings to her skin as she gazes off into the distance, her icy gray eyes glistening with damp sorrow and a subtle closed-lip smile that exudes controlled confidence.

The scene is illuminated by low-key directional light filtering through atmospheric diffusion, casting gentle rim highlights on her high cheekbones, narrow jawline, and delicate almond eyes. The lighting also creates absorbed shadows and softens the overall appearance, contributing to a moody palette dominated by deep greens, charcoal blacks, ash grays, and muted reds.

The portrait is captured with a 50mm lens, utilizing shallow depth of field for focus on the subject while maintaining an ultra-detailed, high-resolution image with film grain, soft bloom, halation, and slight vignette to enhance its analog character and create a calm, contemplative, and timeless visual tone. The setting features mirror-still marsh water, floating leaves, hanging chōchin lanterns, soot-stained, and a backdrop of trees with volumetric rays of light breaking through the mist, adding depth and texture to the scenery. The entire scene is bathed in cold mist with drifting ash flecks, further emphasizing the haunting and otherworldly atmosphere., <lora:ZIT_Midjourney_Luneva_Cinematic_v1_r128:0.50><lora:Z-Breast-Slider:1>
