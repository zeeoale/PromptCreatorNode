A beautiful woman, her eyes closed in a serene expression, is illuminated by a divine natural backlight, a ray of hope in a dystopian future where high-tech cities stand as monuments to humanity's downfall, and yet, she remains elegant and untouched by the chaos, her wounded face a canvas of sacred devotion; the medium shot, captured from above, reveals a retro headset, a relic of a bygone era, adorning her like a crown, its sleek lines contrasting with the intricate flesh-script that adorns her torso, a fusion of technology and body horror, where neon signs, now silent sentinels, cast an ethereal glow, creating a sacred atmosphere, a ritualistic space where she stands, a solitary figure, embodying a fusion of the sacred and the profane, her static pose a testament to resilience and a haunting reminder of the beauty that persists even in the face of a wounded world., <lora:ZIT_Midjourney_Luneva_Cinematic_v1_r128:0.50>
