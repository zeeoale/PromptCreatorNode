A beautiful anime-style woman suspended above shattered cathedral ruins amid a Celestial Collapse, seen from a dramatic worm’s-eye view as moonlight spears through torn clouds and collapsed arches, volumetric god rays cutting the smoke. She hovers with outstretched arms, radiating haunted conviction and divine wrath; a halo crown streaked with blood glows above her while a second, broken halo lies cracked on the scorched flagstones below. Silver hair whipping in the toxic wind, porcelain skin bathed in cold moonlit blues and ember-red accents, eyes blazing with ethereal light. A celestial earring shaped like a cross glints at her ear; a war mask carved with divine engravings frames her face, half-lifted to reveal a resolute gaze. Tattered ceremonial armor with luminous filigree and winglike pauldrons, a wind-torn dark mantle trailing sparks. Around her spreads a burning wasteland littered with fallen angel statues, marble wings blackened and fractured. A demonic grimoire bound in heavy chains levitates at her side, iron links taut as infernal sigils smolder through leather; in her other hand a holy scroll unfurls, edges burning and curling as radiant glyphs spill into the air. A single feather, drenched in blood, tumbles in slow motion past the lens. Composition: centered subject framed by ruined archways and statue silhouettes, strong leading lines to the moon, extreme low angle 24mm perspective with dynamic foreshortening. Lighting: high-contrast chiaroscuro, intense backlit rim glow, moon-blue key with ember highlights, volumetric light piercing the sky.
