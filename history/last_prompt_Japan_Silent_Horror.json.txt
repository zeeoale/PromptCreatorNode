In the heart of an abandoned Gothic cathedral, nestled within a shadow-drenched empty chamber, lies a chilling tableau. A pale, androgynous being with luminous white hair cascading in disarray down a blood-stained sailor's uniform, their skin as radiant as moonlight yet marred by the black, oily machinery of cables and chains fused to their spectral wings - fragile bones visible beneath the metallic intricacies. The mechanical wings, a grotesque fusion of fallen angel and clockwork nightmare, pulsate softly in the dim light, casting flickering shadows on the desolate surroundings. A subtle predatory gaze lingers from beneath heavy bangs, a chilling testament to their full ritual corruption. The camera, poised at an intimate angle, captures this haunting spectacle through the lens of a long focal length, painting the scene with a monochrome color palette reminiscent of the film noir era, yet with a cinematic, slightly soft-focus finish that accentuates the horror's haunting beauty. The overall atmosphere is one of ritual horror, the room suffused with an ethereal, blood-lit presence, as the being maintains a predatory stillness, hinting at unspoken terrors lurking within its mechanical heart., traumakom_asa<lora:bo zImage-Digital Abyss v0.3:1>bo-abyss
