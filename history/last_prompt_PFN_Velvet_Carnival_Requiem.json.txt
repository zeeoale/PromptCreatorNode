A ghostly woman with porcelain skin, smudged theatrical makeup, and a ballet-inspired gown of tattered tulle and cracked velvet sits frozen on a rusted carousel seat, her cobalt-blue hair tangled and loose ribbons frayed at the edges, her icy gray eyes locked in a cat-like gaze that holds the weight of a thousand unspoken lullabies as the vintage merry-go-round stalls mid-rotation, its painted horses frozen in a silent scream, the air thick with dust and the scent of fading wax, her delicate jawline tense with contained anguish while the soft, diffused light of a broken mirror behind her spills across her shoulders in a subtle rim glow, casting long shadows that stretch like whispers across the cracked wooden floor of the abandoned circus, her asymmetrical hairstyle framing a face of soft oval proportions and a cupid bow lip that trembles with the ghost of a smile, the camera’s extreme low angle worm’s-eye view emphasizing her vulnerability as volumetric light dances through the space, blending the melancholy of a forgotten era with the erotic tension of a body worn by time, her presence a fragile elegy to beauty’s inevitable decay., <lora:ZIT_Midjourney_Luneva_Cinematic_v1_r128:0.50><lora:Z-Breast-Slider:1>
