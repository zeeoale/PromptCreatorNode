In the heart of an ancient, desolate battleground bathed in moonlight and embers, a modern dark goddess stands proud. Her luminous white hair cascades down like ethereal silk, contrasting starkly with her porcelain skin and fragile shoulder blades, which bear the vast organic wings of a fallen angel—a grotesque fusion of feathers and torn membranous flesh, their shadows stained with battle scars and ash. The wings emerge naturally, a testament to her otherworldly power.

Captured in an extreme close-up by the newest 4k camera, this masterpiece showcases an absurd resolution that reveals every intricate detail. With a volumetric lighting effect that casts a soft glow from unseen dragon eyes, the image exudes a high resolution, ultra-detailed aesthetic, enhancing the goddess's regal presence and the fearsome atmosphere. The camera angles subtly shift to reveal her battle-worn empress armor, adorned with fire-sapphire earrings, while the background dissolves into swirling smoke, with a blurred dragon lingering ominously behind.

The fine cinematic grain and softly diffused, high-contrast photographic finish envelop the scene in an oppressive and sacred atmosphere, emphasizing the goddess's stoic regality and the magical tension that crackles around her. This is a masterful depiction of a fallen angel, suspended in the stillness of ancient times, yet as relevant and powerful as ever in our modern era., <lora:ZIT_Midjourney_Luneva_Cinematic_v1_r128:0.50><lora:Z-Breast-Slider:1>
