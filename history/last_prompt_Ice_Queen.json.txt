In the frigid heart of a wintry twilight, the ethereal visage of an androgynous Nordic/Slavic fallen angel emerges from the abyss, her pale, luminous hair and skin in stark contrast to the black, oily machinery of mechanical wings that fuse with fragile bone. Draped in intricate winter garments adorned with delicate paisley designs, she tenderly interacts with a horse, its warm breath mingling with the falling snowflakes that swirl around them. The camera peers at this surreal tableau from an eye-level or slightly low angle, capturing the intimate exchange amidst the enchanting winter landscape. A silver moon casts a soft, ethereal glow over the scene, its light reflecting off elaborate silver jewelry and earrings that adorn both angel and horse. The overall color palette is monochrome, with a cinematic, slightly soft-focus finish that lends an otherworldly quality to this mystical winter tale unfolding in the dark void., traumakom_asa<lora:bo zImage-Digital Abyss v0.3:1>bo-abyss
