In the scorched Cathedral of Light, a fallen Paladin's visage emerges, her skin revealing a tapestry of micro-textured pores and sinister marks that echo the damned atmosphere. A single, large soft source illuminates her face from 30-degrees, casting warm neutrals with a fiery crimson accent. The paladin's eyes remain closed, while blood drips from her fingers, staining her tattered vestments of flayed leather. Tattoos pulsate with cursed power, glowing against the backdrop of a shattered angelic wing on the floor, hinting at her entwined fate with the infernal realm. The composition is symmetrical yet tense, capturing the pleasure she finds in her suffering, anchored in the heart of the Hells' blood-drenched altar. The image is adorned with fine grain and a subtle vignette, emphasizing the palpable frequency of her connection to the dark forces that surround her., <lora:darkportrait:1>darkmood
