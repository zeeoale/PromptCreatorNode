In a post-apocalyptic space, an androgynous dark goddess, her ethereal luminance contrasting starkly against the pitch-black void, is suspended. The goddess's pale porcelain skin and radiant white hair cascade, framing a face frozen in terror as she emerges from a haze of nocturnal mist and sacred stillness. Her vast organic wings, scarred and shadow-stained, are formed of layered feathers or torn membranous flesh that erupt naturally from fragile shoulder bones. The scene is illuminated by dim flickering fluorescent lights within a xenomorph hive, its resin-coated walls reflecting eerie shadows. A high-resolution, ultra-detailed 4k close-up captures the condensation on the goddess's helmet and her cold synthetic stare as she clutches a frightened xenomorph in the darkness. The depth of field is shallow, with the motion tracker blinking erratically in the background, creating a sense of unease and impending danger. The image is captured using a cinematic lens, boasting restrained monochrome colors, fine cinematic grain, and a softly diffused, high-contrast photographic finish, enhancing the oppressive and sacred atmosphere., <lora:ZIT_Midjourney_Luneva_Cinematic_v1_r128:0.50><lora:Z-Breast-Slider:1>
