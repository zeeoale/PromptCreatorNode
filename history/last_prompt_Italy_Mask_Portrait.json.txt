In the heart of a haunting Venetian alley, bathed in moonlight streaming from an opulent, Baroque window, the portrait captures a breathtaking woman donning a Venetian plague doctor mask. The extreme close-up frames her expressionless mask, revealing an intricate dance of skin pores and micro-textures illuminated by catchlights that glimmer like distant stars against the deep, warm neutrals of her mask's surface. Tiny specular details create a sense of depth within the grotesque facade, while one fiery red accent from the drapery draws the eye in a subtle yet disturbing manner. The single large soft source from 30–45° creates gentle skin frequency retention, micro-contrast, fine grain, and a hint of vignette that further anchors this macabre scene to its eerie Venetian setting., <lora:darkportrait:1>darkmood
