In an exquisitely executed, high-definition 4K masterpiece, a modern dark goddess emerges from the haunting stillness of a nocturnal mist, her ethereal form framed by the blurry silhouette of a snowy forest. The camera, positioned from a slightly elevated angle with a wide-angle lens for maximum depth of field, focuses on an extreme close-up of her face, accentuating the contrast between her luminous white hair and porcelain skin. Her vast organic wings—a fusion of layered feathers or torn membranous flesh, subtly scarred, shadow-stained, or ash-dusted—emerge naturally from fragile shoulder bones, their sheer size suggesting a divine yet diabolical presence. Volumetric lighting casts eerie shadows upon her wings and the surrounding mist, creating an ambiance of timeless minimalism. The goddess wears a silk dress in glacial tones, its delicate fabric billowing softly around her. A frost crown adorns her head, while she presses her forehead to the furry form of a fox, her eyes closed in a mysterious half-smile. Her neck is adorned with a elegant icy pendant, suspended on a slender chain. The scene radiates an atmosphere of frozen silence and elegantly surreal aesthetic, further emphasized by the soft cinematic grain and high-contrast photographic finish that lends it an air of both beauty and dread., <lora:ZIT_Midjourney_Luneva_Cinematic_v1_r128:0.50><lora:Z-Breast-Slider:1>
