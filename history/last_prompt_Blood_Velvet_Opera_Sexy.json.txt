In an extreme close-up, a modern dark vampire goddess emerges from swirling nocturnal mist and sacred stillness, her skin pores and micro-textures illuminated by a single large soft source casting volumetric lighting. Dressed in a crimson velvet low-cut gown adorned with black lace, she is anchored to the Decadent Gothic Era by the haunting atmosphere of an illuminated cathedral stage with stained glass and cracked opera masks. Her dramatic singing with arms wide open exudes sorrowful ecstasy, and the scene unfolds in a dreamlike and dramatic low-angle shot from the theater floor, all captured in amazing quality, ultra-detailed 4k, with gentle skin frequency retention, micro-contrast, fine grain, and subtle vignette - a masterpiece of amazing detail, best quality, and newest technology., <lora:ZIT_Midjourney_Luneva_Cinematic_v1_r128:0.50><lora:Z-Breast-Slider:1>
