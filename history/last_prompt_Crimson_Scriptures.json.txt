A broken angelic figure, a testament to a forgotten era of divine experimentation, stands in a cathedral-like void, its long, white hair, a cascading waterfall of luminescence, contrasting sharply with the oily blackness of its mechanical wings, which seem to have grown organically from its back, blending seamlessly with the delicate bones; in a close-up, the camera, with a slightly soft-focus lens, captures the angel's androgynous face, illuminated by the mystical glow of enchanted parchment, held in one hand, its golden lingerie, a remnant of a bygone age, shimmering beneath the mechanical tendrils that coil possessively around its fragile limbs, while in the background, a sea of ancient scrolls circles endlessly, creating an arcane and oppressive atmosphere, and in the center, quills made from bone, ink-dipped talismans, and bleeding books whisper secrets that turn into screams, all under a golden, ethereal light., <lora:ZIT_Midjourney_Luneva_Cinematic_v1_r128:0.50>
