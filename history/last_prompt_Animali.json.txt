In the cold embrace of an enchanted twilight forest, a modern dark vampire goddess is suspended, a pale androgynous figure of luminous white hair cascading down her porcelain skin, contrasting starkly against vast organic wings formed from layered feathers or torn membranous flesh, subtly scarred, shadow-stained, and ash-dusted, emerging naturally from fragile shoulder bones. The camera angles in on this celestial creature, capturing the newest 4k resolution with an ultra-detailed, absurdres quality, a restrained monochrome color palette dominated by moonlight, fine cinematic grain, and a softly diffused, high-contrast photographic finish that accentuates every delicate feature. Her wings shimmer with a dramatic shadow play on the lips and jawline, volumetric lighting emphasizing her mouth and teeth in a playful, front view pose. A bearded dragon rests atop a stone nearby, while a floating book hovers gently within reach, as if waiting for the goddess to reveal its ancient secrets. The atmosphere is one of mystical stillness, broken only by the soft rustle of leaves and the faint whispers of the forest's enchantment, creating an oppressive yet sacred ambiance., <lora:ZIT_Midjourney_Luneva_Cinematic_v1_r128:0.50><lora:Z-Breast-Slider:1>
