A pale, androgynous figure with an icy gray gaze and a soft oval face framed by an asymmetrical fashion-pink hairstyle, suspended in a post-apocalyptic sacred battlefield of cracked marble and incense-fogged air, their porcelain skin etched with ritual scars and organic cartilage growths along the spine, draped in dark romantic lace and corsetry that clings to a thin black rosary-like band wrapped around their wrist, their motionless form caught in dramatic foreshortening from an extreme low-angle worm’s-eye perspective with a 24mm lens, casting subtle rim light across porcelain lips and feathered wings of torn membranous flesh stained with ash and shadow, their expression a fractured mask of contained anger and silent despair, the camera’s softly diffused high-contrast monochrome palette emphasizing the ethereal melancholy of fallen grace, the volumetric lighting bleeding through the fog to highlight the delicate jawline and cupid bow, their Nordic features frozen in a tense, erotic stillness as if suspended moments after the fall, the background’s minimalist urban ruins blending with the sacred decay in a restrained, ultra-detailed 4K masterpiece., <lora:ZIT_Midjourney_Luneva_Cinematic_v1_r128:0.50><lora:Z-Breast-Slider:1>
