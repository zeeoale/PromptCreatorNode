In an exquisite 4K masterpiece, a modern dark vampire goddess emerges from the moonlit mist and sacred stillness. The close-up, capturing her head-and-shoulders, is framed with a tight-thirds composition using a 50–85mm lens at shallow depth of field. The focus is on her piercing eyes, adorned with a diadem, while quiet pride radiates from her three-quarter face tilt.

Her outfit, a Ptolemaic fusion of Greek and Egyptian motifs, shines with a beaded net overdress layered over a linen sheath, accessorized with ear cuffs and drop earrings in lapis and carnelian featuring lotus and ankh motifs. A single large soft source at 30–45° illuminates her face, casting warm falloff and volumetric lighting that emphasizes the micro-texture of her skin, pores, and tiny specular details.

The palette is dominated by warm neutrals with a hint of moon-cool hush, accentuating the alabaster panel at her collarbone, which glows with translucent edges. Her ankh pendant adds to the ancient Egyptian atmosphere as she stands in the quiet pride of the Ptolemaic court style. A gentle skin frequency retention, micro-contrast, fine grain, and subtle vignette enhance the overall aesthetic, while fine detail is preserved in the ear cuffs and torchlit micro-flicker. The composition is anchored by the theme's clean temples and calm desert light, presenting a pure classic beauty that embodies authenticity, without any horror motifs., <lora:ZIT_Midjourney_Luneva_Cinematic_v1_r128:0.50><lora:Z-Breast-Slider:1>
