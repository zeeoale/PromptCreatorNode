In a semi-photorealistic, ethereal masterpiece of exquisite quality and resolution, a hauntingly beautiful portrait emerges from the damp, nocturnal stillness of an ancient mirror hall illuminated by moonlight. The humid air softens contours and drifting haze blurs the boundary between skin and shadow, emphasizing pale highlights against muted teal and deep cyan tones, with desaturated crimson accents subtly framing eyes and lips. Low-key directional light grazes the subject's face from the side, creating gentle rim highlights and absorbed shadows, while shallow depth of field isolates her in a quiet, contemplative close-up that feels suspended in time.

The subject, a woman in her early 30s with a soft angular face, sculpted cheekbones, tapered chin, slightly hooded eyes, defined lash line, and eyes color emerald green, wears a Black Stardust-infused cape. Her straight delicate nose, soft, subtle, closed-lip smile; calm, warm, confident demeanor is accentuated by her long wavy hair, heavy fringe, hair color copper red, tan skin with a warm undertone and sun-kissed glow, serene neutrality, and emotionally unreadable expression. A sense of Mediterranean allure envelops the subject as she is framed by luminous forehead gem and delicate feathers, giving the portrait an air of romantic surrealism. The atmosphere is dense, intimate, and contemplative, captured with analog softness, fine film grain, restrained bloom, and a calm cinematic restraint in an eye-level medium close-up, with faint chromatic aberration and a subtle vignette for a quietly cinematic finish, reminiscent of a Victorian setting bathed in the ethereal glow of moonlight., <lora:ZIT_Midjourney_Luneva_Cinematic_v1_r128:0.50><lora:Z-Breast-Slider:1>
