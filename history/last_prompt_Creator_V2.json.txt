In a 4K masterpiece, bathed in an ultra-detailed, restrained monochrome palette and soft cinematic grain, a modern dark vampire goddess suspends mid-air, her ethereal form cloaked in a crimson velvet Dieselpunk Era overcoat. The ghostly figure, with luminous white hair and porcelain skin, is framed by a shallow depth of field that accentuates the vast organic wings, their layered feathers or torn membranous flesh subtly scarred, shadow-stained or ash-dusted, emerging naturally from fragile shoulder bones. Volumetric lighting emphasizes the mouth and teeth, casting dramatic shadows on her lips and jawline, while a sorrowful gaze pierces through the softly diffused, high-contrast photographic finish. Suspended above a lava-filled canyon shrouded in red fog, she stands beside a mirror with swirling smoke inside, her neck adorned by a necklace made of tiny bones, as if to echo the haunting stillness of a sacred nocturnal mist and the eerie beauty of a fallen angel., <lora:ZIT_Midjourney_Luneva_Cinematic_v1_r128:0.50><lora:Z-Breast-Slider:1>
