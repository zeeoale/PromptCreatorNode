Extreme close-up, a cinematic Dutch angle on the terrifying, condor-feathered ritual mask of a hauntingly beautiful Incan high priestess, her face a canvas of divine trance and raw emotion. Chiaroscuro moonlight cuts through the oppressive darkness, carving deep shadows into the polished wood of the mask and illuminating the ancient, crumbling cyclopean stone wall behind her, its faded glyphs whispering of forgotten gods. A cascade of iridescent black condor feathers, shimmering with cold light, frames the mask's terrifying visage, inlaid with glinting turquoise and gold. Through the mask’s eye slits, her own luminous eyes are visible, wide with a mixture of sacred terror and ecstatic union with the cosmos, reflecting the stark lunar glow. On her high cheekbone, a freshly etched Chakana cross glistens, a raw and vivid symbol of her ordeal. The very air is thick and heavy, dust motes dancing like ancient spirits in the slivers of moonlight, creating a palpable, dusty relic ambience charged with the energy of whispering ancestral voices emanating from the mask itself., <lora:breast-size_822995:1><lora:ObscuraDream:0.70>
