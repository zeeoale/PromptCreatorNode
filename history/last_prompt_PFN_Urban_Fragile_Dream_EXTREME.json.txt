A low-angle, 24mm ultra-wide lens captures the intimate, claustrophobic intimacy of a decaying bathroom from slightly below, framing a mid-20s woman with a soft oval face, icy gray eyes, and fashion-pink hair in an asymmetrical haircut, her fair skin glistening with dampness as she curls tightly in a rusted bathtub, her body wrapped in slipping bandages and a torn, soaked slip marked by faded ritual symbols, her wide-eyed silence fractured by the unholy pink-purple static flicker of neon morgue light that fractures across cracked tiles, dark moisture streaking broken surfaces, and the oppressive weight of invasive shadows that coil around her trembling limbs, her Nordic features etched with quiet intensity and unwavering eye contact, the camera’s shallow depth of field blurring the edges of the scene with grainy noise and volumetric lighting that amplifies the oppressive atmosphere of the Forgotten Containment Era, where the bathroom’s corroded pipes leak stagnant water and the air hums with the eerie static of a ritual chamber transformed into a prison of psychological collapse, her vulnerable pose and provocative framing merging the body with the horror of the environment, the lens capturing every detail of her smooth, pale skin and the faint, unsettling glow of the static that reflects on the tiles like a distorted mirror of her unraveling sanity., <lora:ZIT_Midjourney_Luneva_Cinematic_v1_r128:0.50><lora:Z-Breast-Slider:1>
