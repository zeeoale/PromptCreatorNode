In a Decadent Gothic Era setting, a modern dark vampire goddess emerges from nocturnal mist, her skin showcased in an ultra-detailed, high-resolution close-up. The warm neutrals of her complexion contrast sharply with the single accent of blood-red embroidery on her corseted opera dress. A single large soft source illuminates her from a 30–45° angle, casting volumetric lighting and creating catchlights that sparkle like tiny specular details in her eyes. The backdrop is a darkened stage with blood-red curtains, ornate candelabras, and the haze of dreamlike mist. Dramatic side light focuses on her silhouette as she belts out a dramatic song, her arms wide open and bloodlust barely concealed. The image, a masterpiece in 4k, showcases micro-texture, gentle skin frequency retention, fine grain, subtle vignette, and a gentle balance of micro-contrast that blends the subject seamlessly with the atmospheric elements. An opera monocle with crimson lenses adds an air of sophistication to this absurdres, newest portrait that combines aesthetics and detail in perfect harmony., <lora:ZIT_Midjourney_Luneva_Cinematic_v1_r128:0.50><lora:Z-Breast-Slider:1>
