In the heart of an ethereal moonlit Ancient Forest, a captivating woman dons a hooded cloak adorned with delicate fur trim, her visage framed by bone earrings that echo the eerie atmosphere. As she kneels before moss-covered ruins, surrounded by animal skulls, her wild smile radiates a primal connection to nature. The soft glow of moonlight filters through the dense canopy above, casting catchlights on her intricately textured skin, highlighting every pore and micro-texture with warmth and depth. Her eyes sparkle with a subdued, enigmatic glow, complementing the warm neutrals of her complexion and the muted greens and browns of the forest around her. A gentle vignette softens the edges, creating a symphony of light, subject, and setting that tells a tale as ancient as the chants that echo through the trees., <lora:darkportrait:1>darkmood
