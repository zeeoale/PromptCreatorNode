A formidable female warrior, her face illuminated by the intense blue-white glow of the full moon, stands amidst a grove of ancient Japanese maples, their vibrant red leaves swirling in the gentle breeze, creating a mystical atmosphere; her modern samurai-inspired armor, with its sleek pauldrons and leather bracers, reflects the moonlight, casting intricate shadows; over her shoulder, the hilt of her sword, adorned with glowing red runes, hints at untold power; the blade, when caught by the moon's rays, emits a soft, ominous red light; her intense, serious gaze, captured at eye-level, is both mesmerizing and menacing, as if she holds the weight of the world on her shoulders; the air is thick with an otherworldly energy, where floating petals, like sacred offerings, drift in perfect harmony with the celestial light that breaks through the darkness, casting an ethereal glow on her elegant yet deadly form., <lora:ZIT_Midjourney_Luneva_Cinematic_v1_r128:0.50>
