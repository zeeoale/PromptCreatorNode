In the Cathedralpunk Future's chilling night, a modern dark vampire goddess emerges from misty stillness, her serrated pauldrons and vertebrae spine rig sharply defined in an ultra-detailed close-up. Volumetric lighting reveals a mystical aureole of broken gold hovering around her, casting spectral highlights on her warm neutral skin. Her ornate mask with asymmetric horn subtly hints at the otherworldliness of this ritual scene, set against a crimson velvet floor and backdrop of neon drizzle and steam. A single large soft source illuminates her from 30–45°, capturing the micro-texture of her skin pores and providing a gentle vignette that emphasizes the depth of field. The composition is a tight-thirds shot with a Dutch tilt, showcasing her kneeling dominance pose and hand on thigh, exuding a tempting menace in this high resolution masterpiece., <lora:ZIT_Midjourney_Luneva_Cinematic_v1_r128:0.50><lora:Z-Breast-Slider:1>
