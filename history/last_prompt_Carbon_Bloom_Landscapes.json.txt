In a 4k, ultra-detailed masterpiece, a modern dark vampire goddess materializes from the shroud of nocturnal mist and sacred stillness, her luminous white hair and porcelain skin starkly contrasting against vast organic wings formed of layered feathers or torn membranous flesh. The wings, subtly scarred, shadow-stained, and ash-dusted, emerge naturally from fragile shoulder bones in a haunting display of angelic or diabolical beauty. Suspended within a vast void, the camera adopts a floating drone perspective with an approximate lens length of 50mm, capturing the intricate details in an absurdres quality that reveals the fine cinematic grain and softly diffused, high-contrast photographic finish. The scene unfolds against a Post-Botanic Age backdrop, where abandoned machine gardens lie overgrown with flowers, their metallic structures broken and twisted like android torsos. The atmosphere is dreamlike yet oppressive, illuminated by volumetric lighting that casts eerie shadows through petals falling from an otherworldly garden suspended in the void., <lora:ZIT_Midjourney_Luneva_Cinematic_v1_r128:0.50><lora:Z-Breast-Slider:1>
