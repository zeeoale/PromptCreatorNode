In the grim and decaying metropolis of the Necrotic Industrial Age, a hauntingly beautiful woman clad in a tattered gown that whispers of illness, emerges from the sickly green haze. Her visage, a grotesque close-up, showcases a maddened revelry etched into her features, with skin marred by extreme mutilation and adorned with bone-made ornaments that hint at a sinister beauty. Her eyes, pools of sickening desire, glow eerily under the single large soft source from 30–45°, casting an ominous vignette around her face. The cityscape behind her is a mutilated canvas of decomposing buildings and mutilated cyborg parts, a chilling reminder of the horrors that lie within this desolate world. With visceral gore and explicit body horror intertwined with sensual elements, the woman exudes an overwhelming terror that is as seductive as it is unsettling, anchoring the extreme close-up to the theme of a sickening, grotesque reality., <lora:darkportrait:1>darkmood
