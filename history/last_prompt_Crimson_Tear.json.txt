In the grim, high-resolution expanse of a Fin-de-Siècle cathedral, an extreme close-up reveals a modern dark goddess suspended in nocturnal mist and sacred stillness. A masterpiece of absurdres quality, she kneels in despair, her porcelain skin and luminous white hair starkly contrasting against vast organic wings—torn membranous flesh that emerges naturally from fragile shoulder bones. The wings are subtly scarred, shadow-stained, or ash-dusted, a testament to her fallen angelic nature.

A side angle captures the scene, the camera positioned at a restrained monochrome distance, its lens length accentuating the intricate detail of her tattered lace corset and long gloves. The atmosphere is one of mourning, enhanced by the dramatic chiaroscuro lighting that casts fine cinematic grain across her face, highlighting the decaying beauty of her features.

Volumetric lighting illuminates the scene from the engraved silver mirror behind her, casting a halo of light around her figure and creating a softly diffused, high-contrast photographic finish. The marble floor beneath her is etched with a blood trail, adding to the overall oppressive and sacred atmosphere of this extraordinary visual narrative., <lora:ZIT_Midjourney_Luneva_Cinematic_v1_r128:0.50><lora:Z-Breast-Slider:1>
