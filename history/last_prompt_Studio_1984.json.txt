In the heart of an eerily alluring abandoned TV studio of the 1980s, a captivating figure emerges from the neon-lit shadows. She dons a trench coat that seamlessly blends the luster of silk with the edginess of leather, its iridescent sheen echoing the flickering monitors and holographic posters adorning the studio's forlorn interior. The coat's asymmetrical cut subtly accentuates her silhouette, while its slits reveal a glimmer of high-tech cybernetic implants peeking beneath.

The woman stands in a low angle composition, her head slightly tilted to the side with a tasteful smirk playing on her lips. The room's nostalgic gloom is contrasted by the bold neon lights, creating an intriguing interplay of light and shadow that highlights her features. A soft, warm fill light illuminates her face from below, casting a subtle glow on her skin, while a cool rim light outlines the contours of her body against the backdrop of holographic posters.

Through the lens, the image is captured with a wide-angle perspective that emphasizes the vastness of the studio and the woman's small yet powerful presence within it. Post-processing includes a desaturated color palette that harmoniously blends the primary neon hues with the muted tones of the studio, further enhancing the atmosphere of nostalgia and cyberpunk aesthetic., <lora:Asa_Model_AI(ZImageTurbo):1>traumakom_asa<lora:Z-Breast-Slider:1>
