In the desolate expanse of a dreamlike void, a hauntingly beautiful, androgynous figure emerges, bathed in the ethereal glow of a fractured, prismatic light. The new era's modern prismatic aesthetic shimmers across the scene, casting rainbow reflections on the figure's delicate cheeks and lips. An extreme close-up, captured in stunning 4K resolution, reveals intricate details: luminous white hair cascading like liquid crystal, skin so pale it glows against the backdrop of the dark abyss. The woman's bare shoulders are illuminated by broken light, a warm and cool dance of colors that scatter across the depth of field.

The camera angles low, capturing a soft, intimate view of her face in an almost reverential manner. Volumetric lighting envelopes her, casting sunlit tranquility upon her calm, vulnerable expression. The light plays with the texture of her skin, creating a surreal contrast between the woman's ethereal beauty and the dark machinery that entwines her fragile bones. Gossamer mechanical wings replace organic ones, their black, oily cables and chains merging seamlessly with her spine. A subtle film texture adds grain to the image, enhancing the eerie atmosphere while maintaining a cinematic, slightly soft-focus finish.

The overall color palette is monochrome, save for the prismatic light that illuminates the scene, creating an otherworldly ambiance that straddles the line between horror and beauty, evoking a sense of profound awe and unease. The figure leans forward, sunlight across her features, adding an air of quiet intensity to the image, making it a masterpiece of biomechanical body horror, a testament to both the sublime and the grotesque., <lora:Korean_zimage-turbo:1>k0r3an, <lora:bo zImage-Digital Abyss v0.3:1>bo-abyss
