In an ultra-detailed, 4K masterpiece, an extreme close-up reveals a modern dark goddess suspended in a vast void of nocturnal mist and sacred stillness. Her ethereal visage is framed by luminous white hair cascading down her porcelain skin, contrasting starkly against the organic wings, a complex amalgamation of layered feathers or torn membranous flesh, subtly scarred, shadow-stained and ash-dusted, emerging naturally from fragile shoulder bones. Her gaze is intense and provocative as it meets the camera, her expression contemplative and introspective. The atmosphere is thick with artistic imagery and symbols in tattoos, accentuated by volumetric lighting, a minimalist studio setting, and a restrained monochrome color palette that creates an absorbing, high-contrast photographic finish, dusted with fine cinematic grain. Despite the dark and alternative aesthetic, this scene focuses on artistic expression and tattoo culture rather than horror., <lora:ZIT_Midjourney_Luneva_Cinematic_v1_r128:0.50><lora:Z-Breast-Slider:1>
