In the heart of a foggy, moonlit graveyard, a hauntingly beautiful woman stands, her blood-stained Victorian dress billowing around her like spectral whispers. Her face, illuminated by a single, pulsating light, casts grotesque shadows that dance on her pale skin, revealing an intricate web of pores and micro-textures. A twisted grin lingers at the corner of her lips, and one piercing eye gazes into the abyss with a look of dread. Hovering in mid-air, she clutches a demonic tome, its pages glowing eerily in the dim light. The composition is tight, focused on her face and outstretched arm, creating an atmosphere of suspense and horror. The palette is dominated by warm neutrals and blood red, adding to the sinister vibe. A subtle vignette further emphasizes the woman's ethereal beauty against the backdrop of the chilling graveyard scene., <lora:darkportrait:1>darkmood
