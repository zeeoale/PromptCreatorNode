First-person POV: you are a beautiful adult woman, a Kawaii Nightmare muse in a figure-hugging pastel-goth dress, floating weightless in a fog-drenched dreamscape carnival. Blinking fairy lights strobe against the haze, casting candy-colored bokeh over melting cupcakes that slump like waxy towers. Your lacquered, candy-pink nails clutch a twisted doll with frayed seams as stuffing particles drift around you like slow snow. You giggle through glittering tears; the laughter trembles in the fog. A cracked lollipop with a smiling face is pinned to the doll’s chest, while a stuffed bunny with stitched X eyes peeks from the crook of your arm. A toy carousel looms in the mist with missing horses, its mirrors and chrome reflecting warped fragments of your face. You’re surrounded by pastel balloons bobbing in zero gravity, their glossy skins catching the fairy-light flicker. Bracelets made of safety pins and candy beads rattle on your wrists; around your throat a collar jingles with tiny tooth charms, and a pacifier etched with glowing runes dangles from a chain like an occult trinket. Cotton-candy pinks, sickly mint, bruised purple, and electric teal saturate the scene. Cinematic composition, slight Dutch tilt, shallow depth of field with the doll in razor focus and the carousel falling into soft bloom; volumetric fog, soft glow, ultra-detailed skin and fabric textures, high-resolution, surreal pastel-horror atmosphere., <lora:Helly_Model:1>hellymodel
