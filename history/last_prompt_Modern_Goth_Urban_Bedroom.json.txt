Extreme close-up of a mid-20s East Asian woman with heart-shaped, pale skin and platinum-white hair in a sleek, modern gothic loungewear silhouette, her icy gray eyes half-lidded and steady beneath soft under-eye shadows, lips slightly parted with a sensual, smudged dark lipstick stain that glints under the warm, diffused glow of a bedside lamp, her long, glossy side-parted hair cascading over one shoulder as she leans against a weathered wooden bedroom wall, the space alive with layered textures—worn velvet drapes, abstract occult posters, and a scattered array of personal objects like a jade pendant, a vinyl record, and a framed polaroid—subtle LED light spill casting delicate, volumetric shadows across her neutral, introspective expression, her narrow jaw relaxed yet controlled, the air thick with quiet nocturnal intimacy as the camera lingers on the tension between her restrained desire and the soft, grainy haze of the room’s low ambient lighting, the color realm anchored in cool undertones with warm amber accents, capturing a moment of private, cinematic stillness where fabric tension, natural posture, and the faint hum of a distant city outside her window merge into a masterpiece of modern gothic solitude., <lora:ZIT_Midjourney_Luneva_Cinematic_v1_r128:0.50><lora:Z-Breast-Slider:1>
