Dystopian Tokyo 2100, extreme close-up portrait of a beautiful adult anime woman in a seamless flesh-wrapped latex bodysuit with a plush pink fur collar, holo-protrusion eyewear glinting with data glyphs, neon-ink tattoos pulsing under translucent skin. She radiates cruel dominance and sinister pleasure, an intensity that borders on agonizing ecstasy, a grotesque kawaii allure. Sickly neon glare in toxic magenta, acid green, and cyan washes her face; oppressive Tokyo night humidity beads into micro-condensation on skin and lenses, rain-steam drifting as volumetric haze. Behind her: a neon-lit bioengineered forest of fiber-optic bamboo and luminescent sakura veined with cables; bio-mechanical tentacles curl into frame like sentient cables; cracked neon geisha masks dangle from wires, their LEDs flickering; pulsating cybernetic hearts throb in translucent housings like street-shrine offerings. Mechanical parasite jewelry clings to her neck and ear like living chrome, subtly shifting. Composition: extreme close-up, one eye razor-sharp, the other falling into bokeh; shallow depth of field (90mm macro, f/1.4), slight Dutch tilt, reflective highlights and rain-slick textures, chromatic aberration and bloom, soft rim light from cyan signage behind. Style: ultra-detailed cinematic anime, glossy speculars, inky blacks, high contrast, subsurface scattering, intricate linework; grotesque-cute cyberpunk aesthetic with desolate Tokyo expressways and distant mega-billboards blurred in the background. 8K, ultra-detailed, dramatic lighting, crisp focus on the eye and lips, film grain and neon bokeh. Avoid nudity, extra limbs, text, watermarks, censorship bars, or deformed anatomy., <lora:RetroAnimeFluxV1:1>power<lora:Helly_Model:1>hellymodel
