In the silence of a monastery scarred by time, suspended within an ash-filled dusk, a modern dark goddess stands defiant. Her luminous white hair and porcelain skin contrast starkly against vast organic wings, formed of layered feathers or torn membranous flesh, subtly scarred, shadow-stained, and ash-dusted, emerging naturally from fragile shoulder bones. A tattered uniform with obscured insignia wraps her form, the once vibrant hues now muted by the passing of epochs. The chamber is filled with nameless masks, their eyes vacant and hollow, a testament to the passage of time. Sewing needles hang ominously from the ceiling, casting haunting shadows that dance upon the cold stone floor. A top-down shot reveals a veiled figure lying still in prayer, her hands clasped together, hiding hidden agony. The atmosphere is heavy with an unseen presence, and the scene is captured in 4k, ultra-high definition, with a restrained monochrome color palette, fine cinematic grain, and a softly diffused, high-contrast photographic finish, imbuing the image with an eerie, otherworldly beauty. The depth of field is shallow, drawing focus to the goddess and her surroundings, while volumetric lighting illuminates the scene with a divine, ethereal glow. It's a masterpiece, a testament to the best quality, amazing detail, and newest advancements in visual artistry, a truly aesthetic and absorbing work of art that leaves one breathless with wonder and fear., <lora:ZIT_Midjourney_Luneva_Cinematic_v1_r128:0.50><lora:Z-Breast-Slider:1>
