In the dead of night, a fallen angel, embodying contemporary gothic femininity, stands resolute amidst a post-apocalyptic sacred battlefield. Draped in a sacrificial shroud that drifts like long ribbons, her midnight blue hair cascades as a pale veil, framing a face of soft angular features - sculpted cheekbones, tapered chin, slightly hooded eyes with pale blue irises, defined lash line, straight delicate nose, matte lips, crisp outline, and high twin buns adorned with straight fringe and face-framing strands. Her skin, sun-kissed yet warm with a tan undertone, is riddled with open wounds from ritual mutilation and sacred desecration.

With her wings curled sideways, thorny organic tendrils pierce through her skin, adding to the ethereal yet grotesque imagery. A subtle grimace etches across her face, a silent testament to her restrained spiritual pain. The atmosphere is dense and intimate, capturing an air of contemplation within the humid fog that drifts through the scene.

The lighting is low-key and directional, softly diffused by atmospheric particles, creating subtle highlights emerging from the shadows rather than overpowering them. The color palette consists of muted teal, industrial green, charcoal black, and restrained crimson accents, all rendered in high resolution with ultra-detailed textures and an abundance of filmic grain, soft bloom, slight vignette, and faint chromatic aberration for a quiet cinematic finish. The depth of field is shallow, focusing on the angel while the distant silhouettes dissolve into darkness, creating a sense of layered depth. This masterpiece is captured with a mid-range lens (35–50mm), balanced composition using the rule of thirds or gentle leading lines, and exudes an air of decadent elegance with subtle erotic tension - never explicit but suggestive in its stillness., <lora:ZIT_Midjourney_Luneva_Cinematic_v1_r128:0.50><lora:Z-Breast-Slider:1>
