In the hallowed, fog-laden gloom of a graveyard's edge, a mysterious beauty stands, back against a weathered stone wall. Her ethereal visage, framed by the hood of her monkish robe, is illuminated by the flickering dance of a solitary candle, casting warm neutrals and an eerie cold glare across her masked features. The close-up reveals intricate micro-textures of her skin, speckled with catchlights that twinkle like distant stars. A single large soft source, positioned at a 30–45° angle, caresses the contours of her countenance, accentuating the delicate play of light and shadow while preserving a subtle vignette that draws focus to her enigmatic eyes veiled by the half mask. Her dark attire, punctuated by the ancient tome clasped tightly in her hands, completes this haunting portrait, a testament to her Gothic allure amidst the desolate moor air., <lora:darkportrait:1>darkmood
