In the heart of a desolate, moonless night, an androgynous fallen angel emerges from the dense, swirling veil of nocturnal mist and sacred stillness. The camera captures an extreme close-up of their ethereal visage, framed by a shallow depth of field that isolates the figure against the inky backdrop. Their luminous white hair cascades down like silken strands of moonbeams, contrasting sharply with the porcelain skin that bears the faintest trace of scarring, shadow-staining, and ash dust.

Their vast organic wings, a gruesome blend of feathers and torn membranous flesh, unfurl naturally from fragile shoulder bones, the edges subtly stained with darkness. The wingspan, immense yet confined within a human-sized ornate birdcage, adds to the symbolic sense of captivity.

The newest 4k resolution, with its ultra-detailed and amazing quality, enhances the masterpiece's intricate Steampunk Elegance. A Neo-Victorian interior illuminated by dramatic side lighting casts deep shadows on the interior of the birdcage, while volumetric lighting emphasizes the mouth and teeth, gleaming with sharp vampire fangs and gleaming ivory canines that catch the low light.

The figure maintains an enigmatic expression, their lips slightly parted to reveal the deadly allure of their fangs. A regal upright posture within the enclosure exudes a sense of power and control, despite the symbolic confinement. The fallen angel wears a lace-trimmed latex corset and long gloves, adding a fashion-forward twist to the overall gothic aesthetic, yet avoiding any element of gore.

The scene is captured in a restrained monochrome color palette, with a fine cinematic grain and a softly diffused, high-contrast photographic finish, creating an oppressive and sacred atmosphere that lingers long after the image fades., <lora:ZIT_Midjourney_Luneva_Cinematic_v1_r128:0.50><lora:Z-Breast-Slider:1>
