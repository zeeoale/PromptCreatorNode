A young woman in her mid-20s, with a soft oval face featuring subtle heart-shaped proportions, a delicate jawline, and a sharp, cat-like gaze framed by icy gray eyes, stands relaxed on a fog-drenched rooftop, her high ponytail of smoky purple hair cascading over a sleek, volumetrically lit silhouette framed by rusted metal railings and industrial vents, her one arm resting on the cold steel bars while her other hand rests on a tech glove adorned with faintly glowing circuitry and a stitched TK micro-label, her neutral-toned fair skin glowing under a low-key neon spill that merges industrial green and toxic crimson hues, her high cheekbones and rounded chin casting soft shadows against the damp, textured backdrop of a retro-futuristic late-night megacity where distant skyscrapers dissolve into smog pierced by vertical neon kanji signs and the faint hum of drone lights, her expression a mix of contained anger and emotional detachment as her sharp gaze locks onto the camera with an unreadable stare, her thin chain necklace catching the ambient glow of a minimal TK pendant while her arm and thigh tattoos partially reveal a faint TK monogram hidden within intricate patterns, the humid night air after rainfall curling around her face and hair in soft smoke, the atmosphere thick with dystopian tension as volumetric lighting bathes the scene in a restrained color palette of muted teal, charcoal black, and industrial green, the camera positioned slightly below chest level to emphasize her authority through an upward perspective, the shallow depth of field blurring the industrial rooftop structures while the rule of thirds guides the eye toward her provocative stance and intimate proximity, all rendered in ultra-detailed 4k resolution with film grain, soft bloom, slight vignette, and subtle chromatic aberration, capturing a solitary, nocturnal moment of quiet rebellion and quietly electric allure., <lora:ZIT_Midjourney_Luneva_Cinematic_v1_r128:0.50><lora:Z-Breast-Slider:1>
