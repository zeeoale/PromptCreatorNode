This extreme close-up captures the essence of contemporary gothic femininity through a meticulously composed, intimate portrait of a young East Asian woman (Japanese/Korean) with heart-shaped, porcelain-like skin exhibiting smooth, cool-toned texture, faint imperfections, and dampness accentuated by humid air clinging to her face, her eyes—icy gray, softly shadowed beneath high cheekbones and a petite nose with a rounded, smooth bridge—locked in a tense, defiant gaze that radiates contained anger, her lips full and slightly parted in a half-smirk, glossed to a glossy sheen, framed by deep black nail polish and dark lipstick that starkly contrast against her very fair complexion, her long, copper-red hair parted to the side, layered and glossy, its texture blending into the dim, near-future Tokyo night setting where a high-rise window frames dense city blocks beyond, the atmosphere thick with nicotine haze and dust motes, her combat boots worn on the floor, bandage tape on knuckles, and minimal hoop earrings catching the low-key, shallow-angle light that grazes her face to reveal form through precise highlights and shadow falloff, diffused by atmospheric moisture, all rendered in a restrained palette of muted teal, industrial green, and charcoal black with minimal crimson accents reflecting softly across her skin, the scene grounded in realism and emotional stillness with volumetric lighting, soft filmic grain, gentle bloom on highlights, and faint chromatic aberration, while the background dissolves into soft focus, emphasizing her razor-thin depth of field and the neo-noir mood of a distressed crop tee, cybernetic limbs, cigarette ember accents, and peeling wall posters, all converging into a cinematic, emotionally contained masterpiece., <lora:ZIT_Midjourney_Luneva_Cinematic_v1_r128:0.50><lora:Z-Breast-Slider:1>
