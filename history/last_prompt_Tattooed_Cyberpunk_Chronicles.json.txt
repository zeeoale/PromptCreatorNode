In the dimly lit, cyberpunk throne room, adorned with flickering CRT monitors and a tangled web of cables, a woman clad in combat pants embellished with intricate floral embroidery stands. The deep black fabric contrasts sharply against the rusty train cars outside, their graffitied walls serving as a gritty backdrop. Her posture is that of a warrior poised for battle, yet her back is turned to the viewer, revealing a mesmerizing tattoo cascading down her spine like a river of ink. The holographic interface lens perched atop her head pulses with an otherworldly light, reflecting off the bathwater that surrounds her in the tub above. The warm ambient glow from the CRT screens fills the frame, casting long shadows and highlighting the woman's toned form. A tasteful post-process cue of desaturated colors accentuates the red blood and light pooling around her feet, creating a poignant contrast that underscores the ritualistic undertones of the scene. The composition is artfully arranged in an overhead angle, capturing the ethereal beauty of this post-human moment., <lora:Asa_Model_AI(ZImageTurbo):1>traumakom_asa<lora:Z-Breast-Slider:1>
