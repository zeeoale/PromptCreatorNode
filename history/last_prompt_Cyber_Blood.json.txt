In the chilling stillness of a moonless midnight, suspended within an abyssal void, a hauntingly ethereal figure emerges. The fallen angel, an enigmatic being cloaked in darkness and shrouded by nocturnal mist, floats with a calm recline. Their luminous white hair cascades like frozen starlight, stark against the porcelain skin that appears almost translucent, veined with shadows. The vast organic wings, a grotesque fusion of feathers and torn membranous flesh, unfurl from delicate shoulder bones, their tips tinged with ash, a reminder of their celestial past.

The figure's gaze, filled with an inexplicable sorrow, pierces through the mist, eyes gleaming like polished obsidian. A tattoo-emphasizing outfit adorns the body, a blend of futuristic, mechanical plating that intertwines organically with the wings and limbs. The figure rests within a stone bath, surrounded by an ethereal glow from volumetric lighting, casting a soft, high-contrast silhouette against the void.

Captured in 4k resolution, this masterpiece showcases absurdres detail, bestowing upon the viewer an ultra-detailed, breathtaking scenery. The image is framed by a dramatic close-up, emphasizing the body details and capturing the melancholic harmony between nature and machine. Shot with a restrained monochrome color palette and a fine cinematic grain, this photographic finish imbues an oppressive yet sacred atmosphere, encapsulating the essence of horror and beauty., <lora:ZIT_Midjourney_Luneva_Cinematic_v1_r128:0.50><lora:Z-Breast-Slider:1>
