In an otherworldly, dystopian Martian landscape, the era of a once-thriving civilization now lies decayed amidst a sprawling, artificial desert of corrupted data. Amid this desolate wasteland, a solitary, melancholic beauty is crouched, her ethereal form illuminated by the soft, cold blue neon light emanating from her surroundings. The woman's black gown, adorned with vibrant neon inserts that shimmer like ghostly auroras against the moonscape, contrast starkly with the barren terrain and the broken drone at her feet, a symbol of the bygone era.

The color palette is predominantly composed of desaturated earthy tones—ochre, umber, and sepia—with splashes of bright neon hues, creating an unsettling blend of the old and the new. The air around her is thick with the lingering scent of acid rain, adding to the bleak, post-apocalyptic atmosphere. Her face, a picture of sorrow, seems to reflect the emptiness that haunts this once great world.

The scene is captured from a low angle and shot through a wide-angle lens (14mm), emphasizing the vastness of the Martian landscape while also drawing the viewer's attention to the woman at the foreground. The composition adheres to the rule of thirds, with the solitary figure situated slightly off-center, allowing the remnants of the decayed civilization to serve as a backdrop.

Post-process techniques include selective color grading to emphasize the neon accents, lens flare to highlight the source of the blue light, and grainy textures to give an authentic feeling of a long-forgotten era. The image is further enhanced with a vignette to draw focus to the woman, and a soft glow effect applied to her black gown, making it appear as if she is glowing with an ethereal radiance amid the cold and desolate Martian environment., <lora:Asa_Model_AI(ZImageTurbo):1>traumakom_asa<lora:Z-Breast-Slider:1>
