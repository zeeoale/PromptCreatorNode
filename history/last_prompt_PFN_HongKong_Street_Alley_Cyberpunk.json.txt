A young woman with a soft oval face, subtle heart-shaped proportions, and icy gray eyes framed by sharp outer corners stands in a narrow, rain-soaked alleyway of a timeless dystopian megacity, her cobalt-blue asymmetrical hairstyle contrasting against fair, neutral-toned skin as she half-turns toward a flickering sign casting unstable shadows across her cropped jacket layered over a harnessed top, the sodium amber glow of neon spill bleeding into the dirty teal haze while a low-angle camera placed slightly below her chest level captures her commanding presence, her tense jaw and sharp gaze betraying contained anger as steam vents release mist into the fog-drenched air, her ear cuff etched with a barely visible TK mark catching the light from a broken streetlamp that casts a harsh rim glow across her thin chain necklace with a minimal TK pendant, the oppressive claustrophobia of the alley reinforced by hanging cables swaying in the mist and dripping pipes releasing faint steam, her figure rendered in ultra-detailed 4k resolution with film grain, soft bloom around neon, and faint chromatic aberration, the volumetric lighting from discarded tech debris glowing faintly under the industrial green and toxic crimson accents of the decaying urban landscape, her posture exuding quiet resilience through an unreadable expression and a slight forward lean that suggests both vulnerability and defiance, the camera’s tight mid-shot framing emphasizing the oppressive tension of the environment while her Nordic/Scandinavian features and smooth, textured skin contrast against the corroded metal surfaces and leaking pipes that enclose her in a world of harsh lighting, mixed color temperatures, and a deeply corrupt, emotionally heavy cyberpunk atmosphere where every element—from the trash-lined backstreets to the faint halation around her silhouette—converges into a masterpiece of cinematic depth and dystopian realism., <lora:ZIT_Midjourney_Luneva_Cinematic_v1_r128:0.50><lora:Z-Breast-Slider:1>
