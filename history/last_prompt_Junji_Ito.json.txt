In the dim haze of a moonless Modern Japan night, an extreme close-up reveals a modern dark goddess suspended in ethereal stillness. Draped in a rain-soaked school uniform, her androgynous form shimmers amidst nocturnal mist, a stark contrast against the decaying backdrop of an abandoned morgue. Her porcelain skin and radiant white hair, a testament to divine essence, are tainted by organic wings made of layered feathers or torn membranous flesh, subtly scarred, shadow-stained, and ash-dusted from the morgue's stench of dried blood.

Cinematically framed from a ceiling corner with a restrained monochrome color palette, the scene exudes an oppressive yet sacred atmosphere. The finest detail is captured in 4K resolution, showcasing absurdres quality and ultra-detailed visuals. Soft cinematic grain and high contrast photographic finish lend a sense of surrealism to the tableau, where volumetric lighting plays with the depth of field, illuminating every wrinkle on the goddess's face, every crack in the morgue walls, and every droplet from her soaked uniform.

As if defying gravity, the goddess's fragile shoulder bones support vast wings that twist and curve as though born from the very essence of the dark morgue itself. The camera, with an approximate lens length akin to a 50mm prime, captures the scene in a single arresting frame, accentuating the goddess's expressionless gaze and the twisted, 180-degree head of a faceless mannequin suspended beside her, its smile marred by flesh peeling from its grinning teeth. A pocket mirror reflects her scream, shattering the silence in a chilling echo of her tormented existence., <lora:ZIT_Midjourney_Luneva_Cinematic_v1_r128:0.50><lora:Z-Breast-Slider:1>
