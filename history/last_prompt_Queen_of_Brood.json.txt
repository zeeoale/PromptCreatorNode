Generate an image of a hauntingly ethereal and majestic scene in a dark fantasy world: A mesmerizingly beautiful woman of Flesh Cathedral Age draped in a robe intricately woven from flesh, radiating a soft crimson bioluminescence that casts an eerie glow. She sits upon a pulsating throne crafted from living flesh, surrounded by flickering hive lanterns that illuminate the chamber filled with brood eggs and the hum of unseen life. Cradled in her arms is a parasitic infant, its presence both unsettling and strangely enchanting as it feeds off her serene corruption. With a gaze filled with ancient wisdom and tranquility, she looks over her shoulder towards a sea of writhing larvae, embodying a gothic body horror aesthetic. Adorned with jewelry intricately woven from parasites, she holds a scarred ceremonial staff that pulses with dark energy, exuding power and mystery in equal measure., <lora:Helly_Model:1>hellymodel, (-bad hands -unnatural hands -fused fingers -too many fingers)
