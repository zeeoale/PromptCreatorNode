A top-down overhead framing, perpendicular planar geometry captures a mid-20s subject with a soft oval face, subtle heart-shaped proportions, icy gray cat-like eyes, and a low ponytail of fashion pink hair, reclined by a rain-streaked window in a Tokyo high-rise apartment where teal and red neon spill cuts through smoke and film grain, their detached boredom etched into a quiet insomnia at 3 A.M., the worn combat boots on the floor reflecting faint blood-like streaks on the window, while a graphic band tee and ripped denim frame a body language of Nordic/Scandinavian melancholic calm, the moonless ambient screen spill bleeding into the room’s industrial alley glow, a TK graffiti tag barely visible on concrete and a finger-drawn TK mark streaking the window condensation, the subject’s red ocular glow contrasting against fair skin with neutral undertones, their delicate jawline and rounded chin bathed in the interplay of low light, volumetric lighting, and the gritty halftone texture of a peeling poster, all framed by a shallow depth of field that isolates the figure in a near-future Tokyo night where the interplay of desaturated reds, asphalt gray, and nicotine amber underscores a muted, dangerous attraction steeped in noir sensuality, the static television glow washing over their skin like a silent, unspoken rebellion against the city’s endless rain., <lora:ZIT_Midjourney_Luneva_Cinematic_v1_r128:0.50><lora:Z-Breast-Slider:1>
