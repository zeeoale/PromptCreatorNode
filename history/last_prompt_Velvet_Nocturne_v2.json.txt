In a velvet-draped art deco chamber, a captivating figure in her early twenties dominates the frame. Her copper red bob and blunt bangs contrast sharply against her fair skin, which possesses a smooth porcelain texture and cool to neutral undertone. With balanced proportions, an oval face framed by a soft jawline, round eyes with bright catchlights, an icy gray hue, a straight delicate nose, and soft full lips with a slight cupid bow, she exudes a quiet allure that is both melancholic and confident.

Adorned in an evening dress of muted emerald tones, the garment's velvet or silk fabric subtly accentuates her form through precise cuts and expert tailoring. The dress, corseted and soft-structured, clings to her curvy silhouette, emphasizing her pronounced hips and fuller chest without resorting to nudity or explicit eroticism. A single strand of pearls and antique rings complete the ensemble, adding a touch of decadent elegance to her timeless feminine composure.

Surrounded by deep red backdrops, candelabras, and velvet curtains, she reclines in an elongated pose with an arched back, evoking both sensuality and introspection. The cinematic studio lighting creates a soft chiaroscuro, casting rim-lit contours across her body and face, while volumetric lighting adds depth and dimension to the scene.

The portrait is shot with a shallow depth of field and tight framing that amplifies proximity, immersing the viewer in an intimate atmosphere of quiet dominance and refined allure. The image is finished with crushed blacks, analog grain, subtle halation, and a cold cinematic color cast, creating a mood that feels both timeless and introspective. With its masterful composition, stunning detail, and high resolution, this portrait serves as a testament to the Velvet Nocturne aesthetics, showcasing an elegant female figure who is fully clothed yet form-defining through cut, light, and pose., <lora:ZIT_Midjourney_Luneva_Cinematic_v1_r128:0.50><lora:Z-Breast-Slider:1>
