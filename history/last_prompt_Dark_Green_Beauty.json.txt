In a captivating composition, the woman is dressed in a Neo-Victorian ensemble, meticulously crafted from opulent velvet and lace fabrics, exuding a baroque sensibility with their elaborate patterns and luxurious textures. The dresses' dark romantic silhouettes feature intricate corsetry, cascading trains, and dramatic sleeves, all contributing to the Victorian era's timeless elegance. Underneath dimly lit vintage-styled rooms with wooden walls, she is bathed in a golden hour glow, creating an ethereal radiance that envelopes her partially profiled figure. The soft light casts subtle highlights and shadows across her face and the dress, subtly accentuating her rebellious spirit and understated allure. Captured from slightly above shoulder height, the composition emphasizes the intricate necklaces adorning her neck, adding a touch of bohemian charm to the overall atmosphere. Post-process, a delicate balance between contrast and saturation is achieved to emphasize the richness of the fabrics while preserving the romantic softness of the golden hour glow., <lora:Asa_Model_AI(ZImageTurbo):1>traumakom_asa<lora:Z-Breast-Slider:1>
