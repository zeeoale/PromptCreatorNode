Amid the desolate, haunting ruins of a long-forgotten gothic cathedral, shrouded in a veil of ash and smoke, a lone figure emerges. In the golden hour's ethereal glow, the silhouette of a woman adorned in a flowing chiffon top and velvet curtain drapery is illuminated, her cyberpunk aesthetic stark against the plain, weather-beaten stone. With a crystal drop earring glinting in the dying light, she stands with a metallic face tattoo that tells tales of an unknown past, her kohl-lined eyes piercing through the veil of darkness and time. Her gaze, fixed on the camera, is one of mystery and enchantment, leaving a lingering sense of dread that echoes off the bare stone walls, reminding all who witness her of the gothic cathedral's chilling secrets that still lurk within its crumbling embrace., <lora:iLLMythM4gicalL1nes:1>M4gicalL1nes
