In the NeoPop Future Collapse, a figure of quiet urban authority emerges, framed by geometric armor-style fashion against an abstract digital set illuminated with studio neon lights. With porcelain skin, almond icy eyes, and long platinum-white hair cascading over heavy fringe, she exudes sensuality through posture and restraint, her gaze carrying a faint off-human tension. The scene is intensified by volumetric lighting, shallow depth of field, and glamorous detachment with a hint of wrongness, while sharp geometric earrings reflect the city's oppressive geometry. The atmosphere is further accentuated by digital tearing, uncanny facial micro-warp, corrupted reflections, and surreal skin patterns, creating an eerie loss of humanity—still stylish, never messy. This ultra-detailed, high resolution 4k masterpiece captures the absurdres of a runway-perfect future with hidden instability., <lora:ZIT_Midjourney_Luneva_Cinematic_v1_r128:0.50>
