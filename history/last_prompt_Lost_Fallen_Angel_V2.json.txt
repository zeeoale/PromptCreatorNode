A low-angle hero shot, camera placed slightly below chest level, upward perspective emphasizing the androgynous fallen angel’s authoritative presence, their porcelain skin glowing with a low-contrast monochrome sheen as ash settles in the dense, suffocating air of a forgotten underworld chapel, where cracked marble floors dissolve into incense fog and a sacrificial shroud, shredded into long drifting ribbons, clings to their motionless form, their heart-shaped face framed by platinum-white hair cascading in glossy layers, eyes locked in gentle sadness with icy gray irises and lowered eyelids, ritual scars carved deeply along their spine etching a silent hymn to spiritual decay, a rusted iron collar chained to nothing dangling from their neck, wings heavy with the weight of transcendence, their expression a serene acceptance of ruin amidst the ethereal melancholy of a moment suspended between holiness and desecration, the camera’s cinematic framing capturing the vastness of their tragic grace, the soft matte finish of their skin contrasting with the delicate, volumetric lighting that bathes the scene in a haze of film grain, their East Asian features—high cheekbones, narrow jaw, subtle upturn of lips—radiating a decadent fallen beauty laced with subtle erotic tension, the atmosphere thick with the lingering perfume of ash and sacred incense, a masterpiece of ultra-detailed absurdres, where every scar, every strand of hair, and every shadow whispers of divine abandonment and the quiet, aching beauty of a being unmade by time., <lora:Niji_E15:1>Niji art style
