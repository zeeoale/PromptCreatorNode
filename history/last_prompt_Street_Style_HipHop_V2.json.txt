In an urban landscape bathed in the golden hues of late afternoon, a Nordic woman, her face framed by wispy bangs and long hair colored fashion pink, leans against a worn brick facade adorned with posters and torn paper textures. Dressed in a cropped baseball jersey layered over a longline tee, she wears a waist-tied plaid flannel and a fitted cap, while a chunky sneaker peeks out from beneath the hem of her oversized hoodie layers. A skateboard rests at her side, nestled between a utility box adorned with paint splashes and the graffiti-laden walls of a concrete underpass. The scene is captured in a three-quarter shot with a strong negative space, utilizing a 50mm look for shallow focus, a fine film grain, and mild halation to create a moody cinematic finish. The color palette is muted, with neon spill reflections on wet pavement adding a subtle pop of color, while the atmosphere exudes a confident, high-fashion provocative attitude expressed through layering, fit, and body language. The image, masterfully composed in 4k resolution with ultra-detailed absurdres, encapsulates an anime-inspired urban fashion scene with depth of field, volumetric lighting, and a moody city texture, all while maintaining a quiet intensity and unwavering eye contact that speaks to the subject's confident attitude., <lora:ZIT_Midjourney_Luneva_Cinematic_v1_r128:0.50><lora:Z-Breast-Slider:1>
