In the depths of a forsaken underworld chapel, suspended in an endless dark void filled with drifting black feathers, a pale, androgynous angelic figure is captured in an extreme close-up, encased within the scenery of a 4k, ultra-detailed, and high-resolution frame. The masterpiece, shot with the newest technology, presents an immersive, slow, heavy presence, as if time itself hesitates at its ethereal beauty.

The figure's luminous white hair and porcelain skin contrast sharply against the darkness, while her vast organic wings—a diabolical blend of layered feathers and torn membranous flesh, subtly scarred, shadow-stained or ash-dusted—emerge naturally from fragile shoulder bones. Her wing's delicate structure is framed by a volumetric lighting effect, casting soft godrays that cut through the dust and smoke, adding an almost sacred atmosphere to the scene.

The figure dons couture fabrics that transform restraint itself into the primary source of desire. The sensually charged female form is veiled beneath opulent materials, her erotic power expressed through elegance, stillness, and the deliberate concealment of skin. Fragmented ritual armor of bone and cracked leather adorns her torso and limbs, adding an eerie sense of history and decay to the composition.

The three-quarter side view reveals ribs and wings, while her eyes remain hidden behind hair, unreadable and distant, leaving the observer with a feeling of incompleteness that only intensifies the figure's otherworldly allure. The camera angle is a reverent three-quarters side view, approximating a 50mm lens length to provide an intimate perspective on the subject. The image presents a fine cinematic grain and a softly diffused, high-contrast photographic finish that further enhances its oppressive yet captivating ambiance., <lora:ZIT_Midjourney_Luneva_Cinematic_v1_r128:0.50><lora:Z-Breast-Slider:1>
